BOOK [Π. 308—3 39.

The following lines (322— 331) are a poetical version of the direc-
tions given by Varro, de Re Rustica, 2. 2.

323-325. utrumque gregem, i.e. your sheep and goats. Luci-
feri sidere, ‘the day-star,’ or Venus at her morning rising. Cp. E.
8. 17 ‘ nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum.’ carpa-
mus, ‘ let us range?

327. caeli hora=diei. So in 4. 100 ‘caeli tempore’=time of
year, the seasons being regulated by the sun’s course through the
sky. The ‘ fourth hour’ was about ten A.M.‚ when it would be
getting hot. sitim collegerit, ⁶ has gathered drought‚’ making the
cattle thirsty. Cp. A. 4. 42 ‘ deserta siti regio.'

328. Note the change of tense from collegerit, ‘has (already)
gathered‚’ to rumpent, ‘ shall (now) be bursting‚’ i. e. are still burst-
ing. querulae, ‘chirping’ Cp E. 2. 12, 13 ‘raucis . . . re-
sonant arbusta cicadis,’ in the noontide heat. The cicala, or tree
grasshopper, is a winged insect common in Italy. Our grasshopper
is locusta (Martyn).

330. ilignis :iligneim canalibus, either ‘ troughs,' or ‘ con·
duits‚' by which water was conveyed into them from the wells or
pools. Cp. ‘ harundineis canalibus‚’ 4. 265.

332. sicubi, ‘wherever '=si cubi (ubi). So ‘ali-cubi,' cubi being
the old dative or locative form from quis, as ibi from is, utrobi, &c.
For Iovis lengthened in arsi cp. l. 1893 4. 453; also 2. 5. 71, 211.

334. saera . . . umbra, ‘reposes nigh in hallowed shadow ' (O).
accubet, like ‘procubet‚' 1. 145, properly applies to the shadow
itself, but is transferred to the trees that throw the shadow.

335. tenues, either a general epsthet, ‘liquid,' as in 4. 410 (lit.
‘ penetrating,’ as ‘tenues pluviae,’ 1. 92), or perhaps water in a
slender stream, as it runs from the pipes (l. 330).

337. temperat, ⁶ allays ’3 cp. ‘ arentia temperat arva‚' Ι. 110.
Temperare implies giving due limits or proportion, and so correcting
excess, whether of heat (as above) or of cold, as in Hor. Od. 3. 19. 6
‘ quis aquam temperet ignibus ' ς also used of mixing wine with water.
roscida luna. The moon was poetically regarded as the source of dew.

338. alcyonem, cognate aec. = ‘the halcyon’s song.' The (fij-alcyon,
or ‘ kingfisher,' as appears from Pliny's description, was regarded by
the Greeks as a sea rather than a river bird; hence ‘ dilectae Thetidi
alcyones,' 1. 399. The acalanthis (ἀκανθίς) was also called
carduelis from its feeding on the seeds of the thistle (carduus).
Hence it is usually rendered ‘thistlefinch ’ or ‘goldfinch,' but Mr.
VVarde Fowler considers it to be the ⁴ reed—warbler.’
