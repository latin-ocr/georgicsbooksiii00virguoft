NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

sisterhood of the nymphs. mantelia, Gk. χειρόμακτρα. tonsis
villis, ‘ with shorn nap,' i. e. fine and soft. This passage is partly
repeated in the description of Dido's banquet, A. 1. 701—706.

378, 379. reponunt, ‘ set on afresh,' in succession. See on
‘ epulae repostae,’ 3. 5²7· Panchaeis =Arabian, from the fabulous
island of Panchaea near the Arabian coast (2. 139 n.). The allusion
is to the spices, for which Arabia was famous. adolescunt,
⁴ blaze,' from the transitive adolere = ‘ burn‘ in sacrifice, as ‘ verbe-
nas adole,' E. 8. 65, ‘Iunoni adolemus honores,’ A. 3. 547. [Ado-
lere properly means ‘increase' from the same root as al-ere (see
note on ‘abolere,’ 3. 560). Hence to magnify or honour the gods
by burnt offerings]

380. Maeonii, =Lydian, from the ancient name Maeonia. The
vineyards of Mt. Tmolus in Lydia were famous (2. 98). carehesia,
‘beakers'; a large round vessel with two handles. See illustra-
tion in Dic-t. Ant. s. v.

382. Cp. Hom. ll. 14. 246 Ὠκεανοῦ, ὅσπερ ’γένεσις πάντεσσι τέτυκ-
ται. There may also be an allusion to the doctrine of the philoso-
pher Thales, that water was the origin of all things.

384-386. neetare,=wine, as in E. 5. 71. Vestam, for the fire
on the hearth, like Volcanus = ‘fire‚' Bacchus = ‘wine‚’ Ceres
τ ‘ corn,' &c. Ovid, Fasti, 6. 291, says of Vesta that she is ‘ nothing
else than living flame.⁷ The blazing up of the wine was regarded
as a good omen (E. S. 106). subiecta, ‘ shooting up.' For the
force of sub, ‘ from below‚’ cp. ‘ se subiicit,’ 2. 19 n. animum, i. e.
of Aristaeus. ipsa, as C. observes, distinguishes the comfort she
herself has to offer from that suggested by the omen.

387-414. There is an ancient sea-god, Proteus, who knows all
things ; lle will tell yon wleatyon desire to leam. Butfirst you
must seize and bz'na' him, fhr he will endeavour by manz'fhld changes
ofform to elude your grasp. l will take you to his secret haunts,
where lle rests at noonday, thatyozc may smprise lzz'm as lle slumbers.

387. Carpathio . . . gurgite, ‘Neptnne’s Carpathian flood,’ i. e.
the sea bordering on the island of Carpathos, near Crete. So
Milton, Comus, 872, speaks of the ‘ Carpathian wizard.' As Homer,
in the address of Eidothea to Menelaus, Od. 4. 384, &c.‚ whence the
present passage is borrowed, places Proteus in Pharos, off the coast
of Egypt, Carpathio is probably used as a vague designation of
the SE. portion of the Mediterranean.

388, 389. Proteus, in Homer l. c. is the ‘ prophetie sire, the
servant (ὑποδμώς) of Poseidon ' ; in later legends (Hdt. 2. 112) he
is a king os Egypt. Euripidesffilelma, 7, combining the two accounts,
describes him as Φάρον μὲν οἰκῶν νῆσον, Αἰγύπτου δ’ ἅναξ. piscibus
