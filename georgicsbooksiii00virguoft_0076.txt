‘Hinc ope barbarica variisque Antonius armis,

victor ut Aurorae populis et litore rubro,

Aegyptum viresque Orientis et ultima secum

Bactra vehit.'
Quirinus, the national title of Romulus, designates Augustus as
the second founder of the Roman empire.

28, 29. These lines refer to the defeat of Cleopatra's fleet at
Actium. The Nile, representing Egypt, is described as ‘heaving
with war and flowing with full tide: in expectation of victory.
bellozwarlike spirit: cp. 4. 69 n. magnum, in apposition with
Nilum, like ‘ saxosus sonans,' 4. 370. Cp. Thuc. 2. 5 ὁ -γὰρ Ἀσωπὸς
ποταμὸς ἐρρύη μέγας. navali aere columnas, the columnae νο-
stratae, adorned with beaks of captured ships. Four such columns
were made by order ofAugustus after the battle ofActium, and after-
wards set up in the Capitol.

30, 31. The allusion is to the settlement of Armenia and the
other Asiatic provinces by Augustus, in 30 Β. C.‚ the year following
the battle of Actium. See notes on 2. 171, 4. 561. Niphates, a
mountain in Armenia, stands for the country and its inhabitants.
The same event is referred to by Horace, Od. 2. 9. 19 ‘ nova cantemus
Augusti tropaea Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten.' versis, ‘shot
backward‚’ according to the well—known Parthian custom, at the
pursuing foe. Martyn quotes Milton, Par. ch. 3. 323—-

‘ How quick they wheeled‚ and flying behind them shot
Sharp sleet of arrowy shower against the sace
Of their pursuers‚ and overcame by flight.‘

32, 33. The precise reference in this passage has been much
disputed. On the supposition that the words diverso ex hoste and
utroque ab litore refer to victories in the East and VVest, it has
been thought that the western victory is that gained over the Cantabri
in Spain, Β. C. 25, in which case these lines must have been added
after the poem was completed in ²9 B. C. This difficulty is however
avoided if we adopt Prof. Nettleship's suggestion that Virgil is
alluding to the Morini and the Dalmatians. The former had been
subdued by Julius Caesar and again by C. Carrinas, the latter by
Vatinius in 45 B.C. and by Augustus in 34 B.C. A glauce at the
map will make it plain that utroque ab litore is a correct designa-
tion of the Morini in the north of Belgio Gaul, aud os the Dalmatians
on the east coast of the Hadriatic sea. Cp. ‘ extremique hominum
Morini: A. 8. 727. For the force of ab in local deseriptions see
note on ‘ pastor ab Amphryso‚' 1. 2.
