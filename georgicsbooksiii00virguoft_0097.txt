295. edico, ‘ Ι ordain‚’ speaking authoritatively. The infin. clause
carpere oves is virtually an accus. and the direct object of edico
(in Greek τὸ νέμεσθαι). Cp. ‘ errare boves permisit,' E. 1. 9. But
in 1. 297 the subject of the infin. is changed from sheep to shepherd
(as in 11. 330, 331), affording an instance of the free use of that mood
for the subjunctive with or without ut. mollibus, made ‘com-
sortable ' by the bedding of straw and sern. Columella (see Indro-
duction, p. 15 n.) gives the same directions more at length.

struction, found in Terence and Plautus. So ‘ dum redeo,’ E. 9. 2 3.

the foot. ’

treat of a new subject, and to the farmer moving to another part os
his farm (Kt.). See on l. 287.

‘ horrida ' in 2. 69 and mentioned as a favourite food of kids.
E. 3. 82.

302, 303. a ventis, ‘sheltered from the blast‚’ i.e. of the north
wind, since the cotes are to be built ‘ facing south.' olim, ‘ often-
times,' lit. ⁴ at that time,‘ whenever it may be, from ellus, old form
of z‘lle; hence olim is applied either to the past or the future (2. 94.
190).

304. Aquarius set in February, the coldest season in Italy, and
the end of the old Roman year, which began in March. irrorat

ing pot or um. C. translates ‘ sprinkling the skirts of the departing
