455, 456. haudquaquam ob meritum is best taken with
miserabilis, referring to Orpheus, the subject of the sentence;
‘wretched by no desert (fault) of his own.' The whole tenor of
Proteus' address is to arouse pity for Orpheus, whose sufferings were
originally due to Aristaeus. [It can hardly refer to Aristaeus, either
(Ι) as undeserving such a penalty, which would contradict ‘magna
luis commissa,' or (κ) as meaning ‘not according to your deserts,'
i.e. ‘less than you deserve‚' which involves a highly forced, if not
impossible, rendering of the preposition ob.] Cp. Pope, Ode on
St. C ecz'lia’s Day, 96 :—

‘No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love.'

was in Macedonia. Rhesus was a king of Thrace, which is again
called ‘terra Mavortia' in A. 3. 13. The Getae (3. 462) dwelt
further north, beyond the Haemus chain (Balkans) and the Danube.
Hebrus was the principal river of Thrace,now the Maritza. Orithyia
(Ὠρειθυῖα) was the daughter of Erechtheus (3. 113), said to have
