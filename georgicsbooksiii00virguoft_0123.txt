BOOK JV. ι 17—149.

132. regum . . . animis, lit. ‘ matched by his spirit the wealth of
kings‚’ i. e. he felt as proud as a king of his small domain (Q),

134. carpere (also abundare in l. 140), is better taken as the
historical infin. than as depending on primus (K).

137. comam, ‘ flower.‘ Cp. ‘ comantem‚' 1. 122. mollis,
‘ tendet ' or ‘delicate’ For derivation see note on 2. 12. tondebat
lengthened in arsi, like ‘ aberat ipsae‚’ E. Ι. 39. But the -at of the
imperf. was originally long.

139, 140. apibus fetis, ‘brooding bees? cogere pressis, &c.‚
‘ force from the squeezed combs,' not ‘strained,' like ‘premes' in
l. 101, which would hardly apply to the combs.

142, 143. in flore novo, ‘ in early bloom‚' indicates the flower-
ing time. Cp. ‘tenera in herba,' 1. 112. pomis, i. e. the promise of
fruit in the blossoms, to be sulfilled in its season. , matura more
naturally goes with poma than with arbos, as C. takes it. tenebat,
‘ retained,' none being unproductive.

144, 145. in versum distulit, ‘ planted out in rows‚' i. e. trans-
planted them; cp. ‘digesta’ in 2. 267. seras implies that they
were full-grown, when transplantation would be difficult. The same
idea is conveyed by eduram (intensive form, like egelz'dlcs), and the
descriptive phrases that follow. pruna, either ⁶ sloes‚' the natural
fruit of the thorn, or ‘ plums‚' engrafted on it.

147, 148. equidem, repeated from 1. 116, where the digression
begins. haee, ‘these themes.’ spatiis iniquis, ⁵ unkind,' i. e.
‘narrow limits’ os the prescribed subject. aliis, διε. Following
Virgil's suggestion Columella took the subject of gardening for his
tenth Book, written in verse, which begins thus :—

‘ Hortorum quoque te cultus, Silvine, docebo,
atque ea quae quondam spatiis exclusus iniquis
Vergilius nobis post se memoranda reliquit.’

149-218. next J will tell of llze nature and habits of bees, thegzst
of Jove lzimseff. T lzey lzold eveyytlzz'ng in common, ffprz‘ng and
habitation, z'nslz'tutions and laws. Eaclz lzas lzz’s allotted labem,
some gathcring sooa' abroad, others busy within tlze lzz've in their
several functions. Like tlte Cyclopes at their forges, all, old and
young, are hard at work from early morn till eventide. ln stormy
weallzer tlzey do not fly far afield, but romain near the lcive, often
carrying ballast. Bees do not propagate their young, bnt gather them
from leaves andflowers. T luy are prodzgral oftlzez'r lives, and live
lmtfora slzort space ‚· yet tlzc ναι-ε remains unbroken. lv'o nation is so
loyal to z'ts soverezgrn ‚· in lzim their social polz'ty is centred ; lcim they
guard at tlze hasard of llzez'r lives.
