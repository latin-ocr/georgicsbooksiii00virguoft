12 INTRODUCTJON.

time the rising ‘Pleiad shows her cornely face and spurns with
her foot the Ocean stream,’ while in autumn she ⁴ retreats
before the rainy star of the Fish and sinks with sullen mien
into the wintry waters ' (iv. 232—235). The homeliest, and even
unpleasing subjects, such as manuring the land (i. 80) and the
treatment of scab in sheep (iii. 440), are relieved by picturesque
poetic touches. Much of Virgil’s charm is owing to his marvel-
lous power of word-paintingl. Often a single epithet or descrip-
tive adverb produces the desired effect, especially epithets and
short phrases recalling Greek literary associations ²—‘ Ache-
loan cups,' ‘ Chaonian acorns,’ ‘ Iturean bows‚’ ‘ the Cretan
quiver,’ ‘ Cecropian bees‚’ etc. Very numerous too are re-
ferences and illustrations borrowed from the old Greek mytho—
logy-—the ‘wains of the Eleusinian mother,’ ‘the mystic fan of
IacchuS,' the horses of Mars and of Pollux, the poplar wreath of
Hercules; the stories of Scylla and Nisus, Ceyx and Alcyone, Io
and the gadfly, the Centaurs and Lapithae, and the rearing of
infant Jove in the Dictaean cavern. These are generally intro—
duced by way of passing allusions, their several details being
familiar to every educated Roman, from books, from sculptures
and painfflngs, or from memories of foreign travel ³.

The frequent instances of personification⁴ occurring in the
Georgics are due to the poet’s strong sympathy with Nature,
which leads him to ascribe human impulses and emotions to in-
animate objects. Thus, the landseels cold and heat ; the corn—
fields are glad ; the earth is reluctant to admit seed3 Gargarus
marvels at her harvests; plants take heart3 young trees are
taught their lessons ; glades are resreslzed by dew; and the sky
is saddened by the chill rain. That fellow-feeling for animals

Often flowering in a lonely word' (Tennyson).

³ In iv. 490 virgil omits an essential point in the story of Orpheus
and Eurydice, as too well-known to need particular mention.
