A similar eustom to make bees settle after swarming still prevails.
C. Butler in his Fenn'm'ne lllonarclzie (1609—1634), after observations

67. A stress is to be laid on ad pugnam: ‘ istheir going forth be
for battle? The regular completing clause (apodosis) after sin
exierint is turned into a parenthesis, which expands into a long
description of the sray. The sense of the apodosis begins at l. 69,

duced by nam, i. e. ‘if there is going to be a fight, you may know
