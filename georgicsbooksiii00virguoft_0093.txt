BOOK [Π. 236-257.

245. 11011 alio, i. e. than at the pairing season.

246, 247. erravit, dedere, perfects (aorists) of custom‚ where
we should use the present. Cp. ‘ruperunt‚' 1. 49, ‘sugere' and
several more in suceession, 1. 375—382. vulgo, ‘everywhere‚' as
in l. 363. informes, ‘unwieldy,' ‘monstrous,' their bulk being
regarded as a deformity. Ovid, T rist. 3. 5. 35, has ‘turpes ursi‚'
like ‘turpe caput‚’ l. 52. stragem dedere ; cp. ‘ dat stragem,' l.

556. In such phrases dare is ‘ make ‘ or ‘ cause,' answering to θεῖναι,
not to δοῦναι.

249. male erratur, ‘it is ill-wandering‚’ a common use of the
passive impersonal. Cf. Ov. Fast. 2. 22 5 ‘ male creditur hosti,' also
E. 3. 94 ⁴ non bene ripae creditur.’

250. nonne vides, one of the many expressions which Virgil has
borrowed from Lucretius. For others see 1. 56, 187 ; 2. 346 ; 4. 51.
So Aratus in his phaenomena has οὐχ ὁράας. pertentet, ‘ thrills,’
as in A. 1. 502, ‘ pertentant gaudia pectus.’

Our poet Thomson has again borrowed from Virgil here, Spring,
80 , διο.-

5 ‘ The trembling steed,

With this hot impulse seized in every nerve,

Nor heeds the rein nor hears the sounding thong;
Blows are not felt; but tossing high his head,
And by the well-known joy to distant plains
Attracted strong, all wild he bursts away;

O’er rocks and woods and craggy mountains flies.'

251. odor attulit auras is not a mere inversion for ‘the gales
have brought the scent‚‘ though that is of course the meaning. But
odor, ‘ the smell‚’ is regarded as the source whence the aurae,
‘ whiffs,' proceed‚ which are wasted on the gale.

252—254. iam, ‘now’ that they are in this state of excitement.
montes, i. e. huge masses of rock. Take unda with correptos.

255. ipse has the same force as in l. 239=‘the huget Sabellian
boar.' The same idea is conveyed by the heavy lumbering rhythm
of the verse with its monosyllabic ending. Sabellicus = Samnite ;
cp. ‘ pubem Sabellam‚’ 2. 168. The mountain forests of Samnium
were a favourite haunt of wild beasts.

256. prosubigit, ‘tears up in sront‚’ with his forefeet. Subagrae
(1. 125, 2. 50) is the regular term for breaking up land with the
plough or spade. fricat arbore. So Aristotle‚ Hist. Anim.‚ 6. 17,
says of wild boars, ποιοῦντες τὸ δέρμα ὡς παχύτατον, πρὸς τὰ δένδρα
διατρίβοντες.

257. The first atque connects durat with the preceding sentence.
