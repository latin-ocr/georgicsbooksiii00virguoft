Boos< Ill. 4 5—7 1.

Ῑ. 51. tota, along her whole length, sore and hind. It is what
farmers call a “level backed'' cow. vestigia, ‘foot-prints,’ not
‘ feet,’ since the tail would sweep behind them.

60. Lucinam, ‘the birth-goddess.' The Romans identified her
with Diana or JunO. iustos, ‘regular,' at the proper time. Cp.
‘iustum pugnae tempus‚' A. 10. 11. pati =palz'endz'‚ an extended
use of the infinitive after Greek usage. See notes on ‘ tempus tegere ’
(tegendo), 1. 213, ‘ modus inserere’ (inserendi), 2. 7 3.

The long vowel of pati remains unelided z'n arsi, as in 1. 15 5 and
elsewhere. This licence is common in the 5th foot, in imitation of
the Homeric rhythm in such instances as Πηλιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος, &c-
Cp. E. 2. 24 ‘ Actaeo Aracyntho,' ila. 10. 12 ‘ Aonie Aganippe.'

62. cetera, sc. aetas, i.e. aster the tenth year. aratris: arando
(1. 50 η).

63. interea, in the breeding interval (l. 61). superat, ‘ remains
unspent,'=squerest, as in 2. 235, 314. laeta, ‘ blithe,' one of
Virgil's favourite epsthets, applied even to inanimate objects, as
‘ laetas segetes‚' Ι. 1, ‘ laetus ager‚' 1. 102, &c.

64, 65. primus, ‘ be the first,' i. e. lose no time about it. Cp.
‘primus humum fodito‚’ 2. 408. pecuaria=‘ herds‚' properly the
place where they are kept. Cp. Persius, Sat. 3. 9 ‘ Arcadiae pecuaria
rudere credas.' suffice prolem, ‘ reeruit your stock ’ by successive
propagation (C).

66-68. This tone of despondeney regarding the natural course of
things &commonly termed ‘ pessimism ') is reflected from Lucretius,
but is far less prominent in Virgil. Other instanees are the passage
about the tendency of seeds to degenerate (Ι. 199), and the diseases
incident to bees (4, 252). Note also that what Lucretius submits to
as a dire necessity, Virgil endeavours to mitigate by labour. (Intro—
duction, p. 9.) miseris mortalibuS, like ⁴ mortalibus aegris,'
1. 237, represents Homer’s δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσιν. subeunt, ‘ creep on
apace.' labor, ‘ suffering!

69, 70. mutari, ‘get exchanged ' for more vigorous breeders. enim
is not (as in 2. 509) a mere emphatic particle, still less is it equivalent
to ‘ therefore ‘ (Greek ἄρα), as some render it. It gives the reason
for this periodieal change of breeding cows, viz. because the stock
needs constantly to be renewed. The imperative refice is simply a
poetical variation for reficienda sunt, which would make the sense
quite clear.

70, 71. ‘ That you may not afterwards have to regret losses, keep
in advance ² (K), so as always to have some good breeders to fall
back upon. subolem armento sortire, ‘ select a supply of young
ones sor your herd,' i. e. to breed from.
