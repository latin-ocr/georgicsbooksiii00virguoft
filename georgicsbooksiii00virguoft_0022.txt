‘ Cursive ' MSS. are numerouS‚ dating mostly from the ninth
to the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Of these the Codex Gudi-
anus at Berne and another of the Berne Codices are the most
important, and closely related to the uncials P and R. Three
also out of the forty-five Virgil MSS. in the Bodleian Library
at Oxford are held in good repute.

Owing to the rapid popularity of the works of Horace and
Virgil as reading-books in Roman schools, there was a steady
demand for copies (more or less carefully transcribed) as well
as for commentaries on the text. The earliest known commen-
tator on Virgil was Q. Caecilius Epirota, a friend of C. Gallus.
Among others we may mention Julius Hyginus, Annaeus Cor-
nutus (the tutor of Persius), Aemilius Asper, and Valerius Pro-
bus, all in the first century A. D. Much of their materials is
preserved by later commentators‚ such as Donatus and Servius,
down to the fourth and fifth centuries. Copious quotationsfrom
Virgil occur in the works of writers from the Augustan age to
the fourth century or later, of whom Verrius Flaccus, Aulus
Gellius, Nonius Marcellus, and Macrobius are best known.

After the fifth century collections of the classics began to be
made in monastic libraries, and from the ninth century onwards
‘ cursive ’ MSS. were Iargely multiplied. The Renaissance
period of the fifteenth century was fruitful in collections and
copies of MSS„ and after the invention of printing in 1450 their
number rapidly increased. The editio princeps of Virgil was
published at Rome in 1469 ; successive Venetian (Aldine)
editions followed early in the next century. In the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries commentaries appeared by Heinsius,
Burmann (a variorum edition, 1746), and Heyne, whose fourth
edition was revised and augmented by Wagner in 1830. A
smaller one by P. VVagner(1845—1849) served as a basis for the
text of Forbiger (3 vols., 3rd ed„ 1852), specially consulted in the
standard English edition by the late Professor Conington (1858-
1871). A reissue of Conington’s first volume, containing the
Bucolics and Georgics, with additional notes and essays by
Professor Nettleship, appeared in 1881. Ribbeck’s important
