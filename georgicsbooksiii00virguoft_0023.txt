edition (1859—1862), with its Prolegomena (1866), giving the re-
sult of a laborious collation of all the principal MSS, is the

standard authority for textual criticism at the present time.

In preparing my own notes ¹, besides the works above men-
tioned, Ῐ have consulted Ladewig’s fourth edition, with German
notes, revised by Schaper in 1883, and the well-known school
editions by Dr. Bryce, Dr. Kennedy, and Mr. A. Sidgwick.
The older commentary by Martyn (1749), and Keightley’s Notes
on the Bucolics and Georgics (1846), have supplied valuable
information, chiefly on agricultural and botanical matters. I
have also been greatly indebted to the chapters on the Georgics
in Professor Sellar’s Roman Poets os tlze A zcguslan Α ge, and to
Professor Nettleship's Ancz'enl Lives os Virgil, in which the
question of the respective dates of portions of the first three
Books is fully discussed. From the prose version by Conington
and the translations in verse by Messrs. J. Rhoades, R. D.
Blackmooe, and J. W. Mackail 1 have borrowed occasional

renderings of the text.
