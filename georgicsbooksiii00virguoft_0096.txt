NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

284-294. But time is flyz'ng: I must pass on to tell of sheep and
goats ,· a hard llzemefor tlte poet lo adorn, but llze love of it bears me
onward. Great Pales, elevate my strain !

285. eapti amore : cp. ‘ percussus amore‚’ 2. 476. The charrns
of the subject would tempt the poet to dwell upon each separate
detail ; ‘ but time flies.'

286. armentis, larger cattle, in contradistinction to greges or
pecudes. superat=superesm see 1. 63 n.

287. agitare, ‘ treat,' with reference to the poet (289’) as well as
the sarmer (288). Both have a hard task before them, but the glory
of it is worth winning. The sentiment is the same as in ‘ divini
gloria ruris? 1. 168.

289. animi dubius. So animi fidens, amens, furens, &c. The
animi in such phrases has generally been considered the gen. os
respect 3 but it is probably a locative, like humi, domi, &e., since it
occurs with verbs, which do not admit the genitive, as ‘nec me
animi fallit‚’ Lucr. 1. 922, whence these lines are imitated. The
Lucretiam passage ends thus :—

‘avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante
trita solo; iuvat integros accedere fontes
atque haurire, iuvatque novos decerpere flores,
insignemque meo capiti petere inde eoronam,
unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae.'
verbis vincere, ‘ master in language ’ the difficulties of the theme ;
i. e. treat it successfully.

290. honorem, ‘grace ’ or ‘ dignity.' hunc, i. e. which is due
from me as a poet.

291-293. deserta, ‘lonely,’ because hitherto untrodden by a
Roman poet. Virgil imagines himself roaming on the heights of
Parnassus, whence he ‘descends' to the Castalian spring lower
down. [Keightley however takes devertitur to mean ‘turns aside '
out of the beaten track, but this loses the contrast with ardua and
iugis} molli clivo, ‘a gentle slope? Cp. E. 9. 8 ‘mollique
iugum demittere clivo.'

294. For Pales see on l. 1. As the subject demands superior
dignity (290), virgil invokes Pales to bestow it. ‘Awake a louder
and a loftier strain ⁷ (C.)

295-338. In winter see that your sheep are well homeri, with
plenty of straw and fern to protect tlzez'r feet from frost. Goats
should be fed and walered in slalls having a southern aspect. Their
hair is of less value than wool, but it z's useful in various ways, and
llzcy yield abundance of mille. They will find paslnre on tlze
