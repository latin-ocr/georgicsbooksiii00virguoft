sciousness, the nature of mind and soul and their connexion
with the body, the primitive condition of man and his gradual
progress towards a state of civilisation. Such themes‚ treated
by a master hand, must have had powerful attractions for a rising
poet, who had already, as we have seen, expressed his enthusiasm
for the study of natural philosophy and was now of an age most
susceptible to external impressions. Moreover, the two poets
had many tastes and feelings in common. Both were lovers of
nature in all her varying moods, and of the simplicity and in-
nocence of country life as contrasted with the luxury and vices
of the town ; both expressed a keen sympathy with the joys and
sorrows of animals, and even with inanimate nature¹ 3 both
had a deep-seated impression of the hard destiny of man, con-
demned to a constant struggle against adverse powers, which
persistently baffle his efforts to improve the existing state of
things 2. Hence the pervading idea of the Georgics, the ‘glori-
fication of labour,’ finds its counterpart in the poem of Lucre-
tius, whose infiuence appears not only in longer descriptive
passages, but in detached phrases like ‘ quod superest,’ ‘ contem-
plator,' ‘nonne vides ? ’ ‘miseris mortalibus‚' eto-all showing
that, as Mr. Munro observes, Virgil³s mind had been ‘saturated
with the ideas and language of Lucretius! If ‘imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery,' Virgil’s frequent imitation of Lucretius
was the truest compliment he could have paid to his predecessor,
though he never mentions his name.

N evertheless, the points of contrast between the two poets are
not less striking. According to Lucretius, Nature is an absolute
supreme controlling power, operating through universal laws;
phenomena being the visible links of a continuous chain of inter-
dependent causes. Virgil, on the other hand, regards these

lines in Lucr. v. 206, ete. describing the struggle of vis humana with
the opposing vis naturae.
