of success. ‘In primis venerare deos' (i. 338)—0ra et labora—
is the keynote of the poem, the sum and substance of its‘
teaching¹. Lastly‚ Virgil’s conception of domestic happiness,
in such passages as ‘ dulces pendent circum oscula nati’ (ii. 523),
of the simple pleasures of the country, and of a life untiringly
devoted to labour (to which we have already referred), is'purely
Roman, and in no wise due to Greek influence.

The single exception to this pervading Italian sentiment in
the Georgics is the episode of Aristaeus,with which the poem now
concludes ². This is a Greek sable‚ very slightly connected with
the immediate context, and not at all with Italy. Moreover, its
length is out of all proportion to the importance of the subject
that introduces it, a strange and impossible mode of reproducing
a stock of bees. ‘To enrich this episode with a beauty not its
own, virgil has robbed his Aeneid33' yet it is so exquisitely
beautiful that, however much we may feel it to be misplaced
and to mar the artistic unity of the poem, we could ill afford
to lose it.

In connexion with this part of our subject, it remains to notice
briefly Virgil's attitude towards Augustus Caesar as shown in the
Invocation concluding the exordium of the First Book (ll. 24-42).
However exaggerated his language may appear to us, it is never-
theless in keeping with the spirit of the times. ‘ It must be re-
membered‚’ observes Professor Nettleship 4, ‘that the words
deus and divinus did not convey to an Italian ear so much as
the words god and godlike do to our own; and that such lan-
guage when used by the poets‚ although it involved a certain
amount of flattery‚ was a sincere expression of their own and of
the popular feeling. It was quite in the spirit of the ancient
Greek and Roman religions to attribute a divine quality to the
commanding genius of superior men. . . . It is probable that
