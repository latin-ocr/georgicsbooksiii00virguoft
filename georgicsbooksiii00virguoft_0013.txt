JNTR OD UCTJON. 9

phenomena as isolated and independent facts ; hence he accepts
certain results of natural science for his immediate purpose, re-
gardless of their inconsistency with theories and opinions else-
where expressed. His philosophy, so sar as he has any, is
‘ eclectic ¹.’ Thus in i. 415 the emotions of birds and animals
are assigned to physical causes, whereas in iv. 219-227 he
adopts, or at least does not reject, the opposite doctrine of the
Anima Mundi. Also, his account of the spontaneous genera-
tion of bees by a supposed natural process (iv. 285, etc.) contra—
dicts the earlier statement (l. 200) :—

‘Ipsae e foliis natos et suavibus herbis
ore legunt.’

In these and similar instances there is a mixture of natural
operations with supernatural agencies. Again, man‘s conflict
with nature is regarded by Lucretius as a hopeless struggle
against superior powers and unalterable conditions. With
Virgil labour is a providential discipline, imposed by a supreme
Father for the benefit of mankind (i. 121—123). Hence he does
not, like Lucretius, view the gods from an unapproachable dis-
tance, dwelling in serene indifference to human affairs. He
invokes thern as ‘present powers' to aid (i. 10), and bids the
husbandman honour them by prayers and sacrifice (i. 337; ii.
393), and to supplement his labours by watching ‘the infallible
signs' (i. 351) which Providence has specially appointed for his
observation. According to Lucretius religion is a debasing
superstition, from which the study of nature can alone deliver
men, its terrors being due to ignorance of natural causes which
operate without any divine intervention ². He therefore rejects
or explains away the sables of ancient mythology, either as
poetical creations or the figments of a credulous and unscien-
tific age.

Lastly, Lucretius manifests but faint traces of that national or

¹ From ἐκλέγειν, denoting a selectim and combination of various and

often opposite theories, without taking account of their differences.
