same author upon Bee-keeping (Μελισσουργικά) doubtless assisted
him in the composition of the Fourth Book, while the passage,
i. 233—239‚ on the divisions of the celestial sphere is partly trans-
lated from an astronomical poem by Eratosthenes of Alexandria.

Of the Greek prose writers, Xenophon in his Oeconomz'ca gives
minute directions upon the choice of soils, fallowing, preparing
the ground, and sowing the seed; also upon vine and olive
planting, depth of trenches, and the care of vineyards· In the
First and Second Books of the Georgics Virgil's treatment of
these subjects closely resembles that of Xenophon. Aristotle
de Animalibus is Virgil⁷s authority for some curious statements
about animals in iii. 255, 280, 388 ; and Theophrastus on
Botany for certain portions of the Second Book.

Among the early Latin writers on agriculture were Cato the
elder (234—149 ΗΟ), author of a still extant treatise, the two
Sasernae, and Tremellius Scrofa (about 100 Β. c.). But Virgil
was chiefly indebted to his immediate predecessor, Terentius
Varro¹‚ whose work, de Re Rustica, was published in 37 Β. C.,
when the Georgics were already begun. From Varro he derived
much valuable information upon the breeding and training of
horses, the management of cattle, sheep and goats, and dairy
farming, besides the greater part of his materials for the Fourth
Book.

The influence of Lucretius upon Virgil in the composition of
the Georgics is of still greater importance. This subject is fully
discussed by Professor Sellar in the sixth chapter of his Vz’rgz‘l:
we select only a few of the principal points for consideration.

The poem de Rerum lValm'a is an exposition in six Books of
the philosophical system of Epicurus. lt deals with the origin
and composition of matter, the formation of the universe, the
beginnings and growth of animal life, sense perception and con-

primus Cato instituit, quem deinde Terentius [Varro] expolivit,—mox
Vergilius laude carminum extulit.’
