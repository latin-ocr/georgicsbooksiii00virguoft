altered conditions. The evidence of later Roman agricultural
writers clearly shows that to them it presented no difficusty‘.
Even in this country and at the present day, allowance being
made for differences of soil and climate, many of Virgil's rules
and methods of agriculture are worthy of attention.

The Greek title Georgica (γεωργικά) denotes a treatise on
Husbandry‚ and the principal contents of the poem are set forth
in the opening lines of the First Book.

Virgil’s professed purpose was to give practical instruction in
everything connected with agriculture, a theme well worthy of a
naaion, whose highest magistrates in olden days—Cincinnatus,
Fabricius, Curius Dentatus, and the rest—had been cultivators
ofthe soil. Regarded from this point of vieW‚ the Georgics form
one of a series of treatises de Re Rustica, extending from about
the third century Β. C. to the first century of our era.

Publius Vergilius² Maro, the son of a small landowner, was
born at Andes, near Mantua. When about seventeen years of
age, he removed to Rome, and, after a short course of rhetoric,
began the study of philosophy under Siron, the Epicurean. We
learn from one of his minor poems, written about this time, and
more especially from the well-known passage in Georg. ii. 475,
etc., that natural science had peculiar attractions for his mind.
That the recently published poem of Lucretius, de Rerum Natura
exercised a powerful influence in determining the direction of his
studies we shall presently see. How long Virgil remained in
Rome is uncertain ; but after some years he returned to his native
Andes, where in the diligent pursuit of farm-work he gained that
practica] experience which was hereafter to bear fruit in the
Georgics. During the interval between 42 or 41 and 37 B. C., he
was employed upon the Eclogues, a set of pastoral or bucolic
poems, chiefly in imitation of the ldylls of Theocritus. It is
