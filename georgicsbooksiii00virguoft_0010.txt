6 INTRODUCTIOM ·

a poem whose object is to teach (διδάσκειν) or give information
upon a definite subject. Before the existence of a prose litera-
ture, such information was necessarily imparted in verse, and
the tendency was to subordinate poetical treatment to practical
utility. The earliest Greek example is Hesiod's Works and
Days. This, in the form of a personal address to an improvi-
dent brother Perses, consists of a number of detached precepts
on right conduct, household thrift‚ and husbandry, with a
calendar of days ¹ and seasons adapted for various operations in
the homestead and on the farm. In ii. 176 Virgil expressly in-
timates his intention of taking Hesiod for his model, but his
direct imitation's are almost entirely confined to a few passages
in the First Book of the Georgics 2.

During the middle period of Greek literature didactic poetry
fell into disuse‚ but it was revived by the Alexandrian writers of
the 3rd century, B.C.‚ as a means of systematic instruction.
The style of these poets is wholly artificial; the Hesiodic spirit,
the quaint old-world flavour of the primitive didactic epos has
evaporated‚ and what is left is a mere digest in verse of second-
hand scientific information. The phaenomena and Dz‘osemez'a
ofv Aratus are still extant. From the latter Virgil borrowed the
passage on weather signs in i. 351, etc„ selecting and abridging
his materials so as to keep the poetical rather than the didactic
purpose steadily in view. Nicander of Colophon wrote a poem
called leeriaca (Θηριακά) on venomous beasts, whence Virgil
drew his directions for getting rid of snakes and his description
of the Calabrian serpent in iii. 414—439. A lost work by the

¹ Hence the title‚’‘Ep·ya καὶ Ἡμέραι, i.e. sai-ming work and a list of
lucky and unlucky days. The nearest English parallel is the Five
Hundrcd Points of Good Husbandry, by Thomas Tusser, written in the
sixteenth century.

² E. g. the reign of Jove (i. 125, eto), construction of the plough
(169—174)‚ notice oflucky and unlucky days, much abridged (2765287),
natural calendar derived from observation of the stars (204, etc.) or the
migration of birds (ii. 320), with a few homely maxims on various
occasmns.
