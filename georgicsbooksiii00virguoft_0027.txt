ΛΝΒ EMENDA TIONS. 23

FOUR'I'H BOOK.

IV. 12 5. The reading altis is found in the Vatican, the Medicean, and
most of the other MSS„ and is supported by Servius; hence it is better
retained. Areia, a somewhat easier reading (see note), occurs in the
Palatine Codex, and is adopted in several editions.

202. Some MSS. (with M.) read refigunt, but this verb has uniformly
the sense of ‘ unfasten.' There is sufficient authority for the text reading
refingunt, though the word is extremely rare.

228. It is doubtful whether the right reading is augustam or angustam.
The MS. authority is in favour of the sormer3 but, here again, as in
3. 456, the difference is small. On the whole perhaps augustam, in
context with thesauris, is more in keeping with the dignified language
which Virgil everywhere employs respecting the commonwealth of bees
(see ll. 4, 5, 153, etc.)‚ and Ι have therefore adopted it. The Palatine
Codex reads thensauri (thesauri).

233. Either spelling, Pleas (Pal.) or Plias (Med.) is correct. The
form Pleias is a trisyllable‚ as Pleiadas (Πληίαδας) in 1. 138.

291—293. The order of these three lines varies in different MSS.; the
sense does not enable us to decide which order is the right one. Some
editors have supposed that Virgil originally wrote ll. 291, 291 as
alternative lines, not intending both of them to stand; but this is
merely a conjecture, nor is there anything to show that any one of the
lines deserves to be excluded.

449. The MSS. are about equally divided between lassis and lapsis.
Both expressions occur, but the parallel of ‘ fessis rebus ' (see note) may
perhaps be allowed to decide in favour of lassis.

493. The majority of MSS. read Averni, as in text. Med. has
Avernis. The Roman (R) reads stagni est for stagnis.
