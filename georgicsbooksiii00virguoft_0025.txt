AND EMENDATIONS.

THIRD BOOK.

111. 38. There is much to be said in favour of the reading orbes for
angues, which is found in the Roman Codex ( R). No ancient poet or
mythologer ever mentions snakes as forming part of the punishment of
Ixion, only the perpetually revolving-wheel‚ which is constantly referred
to. The phrase ‘ Ixionis orbes’ occurs in Propert. 4. 11. 33 and Ovid,
Met. 10. 42 (cp. also G. 4. 484) ; ‘ tortos orbes' in A. 12. 481, though in
a different connexion. If orbes were the original reading here, it might
have been altered to angues by someone who had in mind the snake
whips of Tisiphone and the other Furies (A . 6. 572) or similar passages
in which snakes are mentioned in connexion with the tortures in the
lower world. Otherwise it would be difficult to account sor the change.
The construction of orbes with immanemque rotam would form a
hendiadys, such as is very common in Virgil‚=‘the whirling circle of
the vast (or cruel) wheeL'

85. Many editors adopt the reading fremens of the Medicean MS.
(M), but premens has the best authority. Either makes good sense.

92. There is no authority of any value for the variant reading effudit.
It was no doubt introduced to suit the tense of implevit following.
But see note. ⁴

188. The old reading was audiat, perhaps from audire inl. 184. But
all the best authorities have audeat, as in the text. Ladewig unneces-
sarily substitutes gaudeat.
