NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

‘ placidi straverunt aequora venti.' Orpheus is said to have charmed
the winds by his music, Hor. Od. 1. 12. 10.

487. legem, ‘ condition? See on 1. 493 below. To this was
added the further condition that Orpheus should not look back,
until he had passed the boundaries of Hell. Ovid in his more de-
tailed account ffllet. 10. 50) mentions this expressly :—

‘ Hanc simul et legem Rhodopeius accipit heros,
ne flectat retro sua lumina, donec Avernas
exierit valles, aut irrita dona futura.'

489-491. Manes, =the infernal powers, as in 1. 505. luce sub
ipsa, ‘ on the vcrge of light ’<Kt.). For victus animi see on ‘ animi
(lubius,' 3. 289. The meaning is ‘vanquished in his resolve,’ i.e.
unable to control his feelings.

493, 494. foedera, = legem in l. 487, ¹ conditions ' defined as in
a bond or treaty between Orpheus and Pluto. Cp. ‘leges et soedera,’
1. 60. fragor, ‘ crash’ of thunder, probably the signal os Eurydice's
return to the shades. stagnis properly refers to the actual lake Avernus
in Campania, supposed to be the entrance to Hades (l. 467 n.).

495, 496. furor is explained by ‘ dementia ' in l. 488. iterum
retro (like our ‘back again ³) is strictly speaking a pleonasm, mean—
ing simply ‘ recalls.' natantia ‘ swimming‚' of the eyes dimmed by
approaching death. Cp. Ov. Met. 5. 71, ‘iarn moriens oculis sub
nocte natantibus atra.'

499, 500. in auras commixtus expresses the idea of ‘ dissolving
into the air ’ and gradually ‘ mingling’ with it. diversa ‘ away,’ in
an opposite direction. Cp. ‘ quo diversus abis ⁴? ’ A. 5. 166.

501. prensantem umbras, ‘ clutehing the darkness' or ‘vain
shadows ' (Rhoades) ; not the shade of Eurydice in particular,
though the plural ‘ umbrae ‘ is sometimes used of the shade of one
person, as of Anchises in A. 5. 81.

502, 503. praeterea, ⁴ theneeforth‚’ i. e. ‘ any more‚' as in A. 1. 49
‘quis numen Iunonis adoret praeterea?' portitor Orci, Charon,
whose office is described in A. 6. 298, διε. Cp. Eur. Alc. 440 ὃς δ’
ἐπὶ κώπᾳ πηδαλίῳ τε ’γέρων νεκροπομπὸς ἵζει. paludem, in reference
to the dead sluggish water of the Styx, as of the Cocytus in l. 449.

504, 505. faceret, the deliberative conjunctive, ‘ what was he to
d0?' Cp. the famous air in Gluck’s opera Offeo, beginning Clze
far& . . . dove andra, &c. (‘ what shall Ι do, whither shall Ι g0, reft of
my loved Eurydice ’Β ’). Manes (l. 489) and numina both refer to
the infernal powers.

506. This line is by no means useless or irrelevant, as some com-
mentators have pronounced it to be. It expresses the utter helpless-
ness of Orpheus' position, since ‘even now' she was passing the
