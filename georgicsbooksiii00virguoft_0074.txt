NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

6. The story of Hylas, the favourite os Hercules, ravished by
water-nymphs on account os his beauty, is told in the 13th Idyll of
Theocritus. Cp. E. 6. 43. cui, either dat. of agent, ‘ by what
poet,⁷ a common Greek construction, or (perhaps) the dat. ethicus:
⁴ who has not heard tell of.' Delos, the sacred isle in which Latona
(Leto) bore Apollo and Artemis.

7, 8. Hippodame or Hippodamia, the daughter of Oenomaus.
king of Pisa, was won by Pelops for his bride, aster he had defeated
her father in a chariot-race. Hence acer equis = ‘ keen charioteer.'
The story is alluded to in the opening lines of Eur. [ph. in T auris—

Πέλοψ ὃ Τανταλεΐος εἷς Πῖσαν μολὼν

θοαῖσιν ἵπποις Οἰνομάου γαμεῖ κόρην.
The ‘ivory shoulder' (substituted for the one eaten by Demeter at
the banquet of Tantalus) forms part of the well-known legend of
Pelops. Pindar refers to it in his first Olympic ode.

9. tollere humo, i. e. rise from the vulgar throng and soar alost.
The idea is sully developed by Horace, Od. 2. 20, where the poet
imagines hiinselstransformed into a bird. The phrase virum . . . ora
is borrowed from Ennius' epitaph on himself, ending with the words
volito vivus jver om virum, ‘ float upon the lips of men‚' i. e. be con-
tinually in their mouths. victor, ‘ triumphant ' over all rivals or
detractors.

10-48. Under the figure osa conqueror leading home the Muses
in triumph, Virgil proposes to celebrate Augustus in verse. In the
' following allegory the temple is the poem, Caesar its tutelar deity,
the poet officiating as high priest. The sculptures and statues,
representing the victories of Augustus and his royal line, are the
subjects of the poem. Games and stage-plays were the usual ac-
cessories of a triumph.

10. primus, &c.‚ as the first rural poet, the Hesiod of Italy (2.
176). 'l‘he ‘ Aonian mount ’ (Milton, P. L. 1. 15) formed a portion
of Mt. Helicon in Boeotia, the Muses' seat. So Lucretius, 1. 117,
says of Ennius—‘ qui primus amoeno detulit ex Helicone perenni
fronde coronam.’

12. Idumaeas is what is termed an ornamental or ‘literary’
epithet, when an object is designated -by the name of some place
specially noted sor it, as Idumaea (Edom) was for its palm-trees.
Cp. 1. 345, also ‘Chaoniam glandem‚' Ι. 8, ‘Strymoniae grues‚' 1.
120, ‘ Hyblaeis apibus‚' E. 1. 55. Here the use of the epithet is
misleading‚ as it suggests the bringing of palms from Idumaea to
Mantua, which of course is not intended.

13-15. Temples were dedicated after a victory in sulfilment of a
vow made during the campaign. The river site is suggested by the
