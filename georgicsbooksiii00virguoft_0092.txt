NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

the instruments os attack, i. e. ‘ thrust with wrathsul horn.’ ob·
nixus, &c. (1. 222), ‘ butting against a tree trunk.' ad. pugnam
proludit, ‘ rehearses for the coming fray.’

236. signa movet, ‘advances his standard,' or ‘breaks camp ’
(Rhoades)‚ like an enemy preparing for battle.

237-241. This simile is partly imitated from Hom. Il. 4. 422-
426. The points of comparison with the bull are the gathering
strength of the distant wave and the force with which it dashes upon
the shore. The rest is merely ornamental.

237, 238. The construction is uti trahit . . . cum coepit, &c.
The first que is explanatory, coupling ex alto with longius, ‘ from
further back, even from the deep,’ i. e. ‘ from the further deep' (K).
sinum is the ‘curve' of the lengthening wave. ut is generally
taken as repeating uti, ‘ and as‚' &c., but Kennedy may be right in
taking it utque volutus (est), ‘ as soon as it has rolled to shore.'
So est is omitted after ‘ubi collectum,' 1. 235. For the language
cp. ll. 4. 424 πόντῳ μέν τε πρῶτα κορύσσεται, αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα Χέρσῳ
ῥηγνύμενον με’γάλα βρέμει.

239. ipso, as in l. 255, expresses size and bulk=‘a huge
mountain.’ Cp. A. 1. 105 ‘praeruptus aquae mons.' [C. renders
it ‘their parent cliff‚’ of which saxum is a part, but this is less
likely]

240, 241. exaestuat, ‘boils up.' Cp. A. 1. 107 ‘furit aestus
harenis.’ alte subiectat, ‘ tosses alost) For the sub=⁴ from be-v
neath ’cp. 4. 385 n. The greater part of this description (from l.
229) is imitated in Thomson’s Sprz'tzg, 791-805‚ beginning——

‘Through all his lusty veins
The bun, deep-scorched, the raging passion feels'

242-283. T he power of Leve z's z'n fact universal. T lte lioness,
tlze bear, llze teger, the wild-boar, all feel its influmce .· lzorses z'n-
furialed hy tlze passion go wz'ld and defit control. T lze lover, recleless

242. adeo emphasises omne, ‘ nay ⁹ or ‘ in fact every raee.’ Cp.
‘tuque adeo‚' 1. 24, ‘thou above all‚' also ‘ usque adeo‚' E. 1. 12,
‘ hinc adeo,' E. 9. 59. Note the hypermeler, que being elided before
et in the following line. Cp. 1. 377, 2. 244, 443; also ‘sulfur(a),'
l. 449. ‘ horrid(a)‚’ 2. 69, and ‘ umor(em)‚’ 1. 295.
