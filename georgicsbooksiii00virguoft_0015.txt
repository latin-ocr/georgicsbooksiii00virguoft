INTRODUCTJON. 11

Altogether‚ the general effect of the Lucretian metre, save in
isolated passages of a more exalted tone, is one of ruggedness
and monotony‚ compared with the exquisitely tempered variety
of Virgil's harmonious verse.

The interest of the Georgics for modern readers is less con-
cerned with the practical value of the author’s directions or the
accuracy of his information‚ than with his treatment of the sub-
ject as a work of art appealing to the imagination. His object
being to delight as well as to instruct, he is chary of prosaic
details, even where perspicuity might seem to require them, and
he evidently regarded occasional obscurity as in any case pre-
ferable to tediousness. Professor Sellar justly observes (p. 231)
‘ The secret of Virgil’s power lies in the insight and long-prac-
tised meditation through which he abstracts the single element
of beauty from common sights and the ordinary operations of
husbandry.’ Instances occur on every page of the Georgics.
When giving directions for breaking up the clods, harrowing‚
and cross-ploughing, he represents the farmer as ‘helping the
field, while Ceres from above looks down graciously upon his
labours’ (i. 95, 96). Irrigation introduces a picture of the hus-
bandman ‘ inviting the rill to descend from the channelled slope
and allay the patched soil with its bubbling streams' (i. 107). A
prognostic of harvest from the flowering walnut-tree is expressed
in the beautiful lines :—

⁴ Contemplator item, cum se nux plurima silvis
induet in florem, et ramos curvabit olentes’
(i. 187, 188).

The grafting process makes the tree ‘shoot skyward with
joyous boughs and to view with wonder its strange foliage
and fruit not its own' (ii. 81, 82). In late autumn ‘Aquilo
shatters the leafy honours of the groves ’ (ii. 404). Mares in
soal are to be put to graze ‘by brimming rivers, where moss
grows and the grass is greenest on the banks‚ by sheltering
caves and jutting shadows of the cliff'1 (iii. 143—145). In spring-
