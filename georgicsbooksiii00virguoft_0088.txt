185-193. It is interesting to compare with this passage an ae-
count of the modern ‘ Rarey' system of horse-breaking, and note its
points of agreement with that advocated by Virgil. “ The chief
object is to remove sear by letting the colt examine all formidable
objects by sight or touch or smell. To do this, educate the colt
by coaxing and patting his neck, till you get the halter on. Then
gently lead him in a circle without oversatiguing him. Endeavour
so to handle him, that he shall not find out his own strength or
power of resistance. All is to be done by patience and frequent
short Iessons‚ to teach the colt to do what you want without hurting
or scaring him.'‘
