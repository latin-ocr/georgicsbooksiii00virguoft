BOOK JV. 8-46.

shallow stream like a vast sea (Ladewig). sparserit, ‘ sprinkled ’
with the spray or a shower of rain. [Keightley takes it to mean
‘ scattered' when at a distance from home, and thus making them
too tired to cross the water without the help os ‘ bridges.']

30, 31. casiae (2. 213 τι), ‘the spurge-flax,’ a fragrant plant, not
the same as the casia of 2. 466, which is an Eastern aromatic shrub
(Kt.). sex-pulla ί ἕρπυλλον from ἕρπειν), probably ‘wild thyme.'
thymbrae, a species of ‘savory' (satureia). graviter spirantis,
‘strong scented ε but not, according to the usual sense of gravis
(3. 415, 451) denoting an unpleasant smell.

32. irriguum (transitive), ‘ watering,’ usually ‘ well—watered '
(of meadows, &c.). Cp. ‘rigui amnes,‘ 2. 485, Tibull. 2. Ι. 44
‘ tum bibit irriguas fertilis hortus aquas.’

33, 34. corticibus, ‘ bark ' of the cork-tree (suber). Cp. 2. 453.
Cork hives were reckoned the best, being warm in winter and cool
in summer. The straw hive seems to have been as yet unknown.
alvaria, properly a place for hives, here =alvz'.

35, 36. angustos aditus. Another, and perhaps the most im-
portant reason sor this injunction, was to keep out beetles and other
insects (l. 243, &c.). cogit, ‘ congeals.' liquefacta remittit,
‘ melts again,' i. e. thaws after sreezing.

37, 38. apibus, either ‘ by' or ‘ sor the bees,’ dative in either
case. Cp. ‘metuendus Iuppiter uvis,' 2. 419. nequiquam, ‘to no
purpose,⁷ i. e. their labour is not futile. tenffia, scanned as tenvia,
as in Ι. 397. Cp. ‘ fluviorum ' 1. 482, ‘ genssa labant ' A. 2. 43²-

39—41. spiramenta, ‘crevicesff If fuco be the ‘pollen’ (lit.
‘ dye' or colouring matter of the flowers), the phrase fuco et
floribus is a hendiadys = fuco florum. But possibly the fucus is the
same as the gluten,viz. a sticky substance collected from resinous buds
os the poplar, horse-chestnut and other trees, and known as propolis or
‘ bee-glue.' In that case floribus by itself will be the ‘ pollen,’ as
in l. 250. Here, as elsewhere, Virgil is not very precise, and fucus
is not elsewhere used in anything like this sense. oras, probably
the ‘edges' or ‘rims’ os the entrances, and explent not ‘ stop up‚’
but ‘ cover’ or ‘line ' these edges, so as to leave the smallest possible
hole. For the pine woods of Mt. Ida, see on ‘ Idaeas pices‚’ 3. 450.
The epithet Phrygiae distinguishes it from the Cretan mountain of
the same name. ⁴

42, 43. effossis, probably by the bees themselves : at least
humble-bees are known to do se. fovere, aorist of custom (3. 246,
247) ‘ make a snug home? Cp. ‘ fovit humum ’ 3. 4²0· For
1arem=domum see on 3. 344.

45, 46. tamen, ‘notwithstanding’ the bees’ work kl. 38, &c.)‚
