452. magis praesens, &c. Conington translates ‘a favourable
crisis in the disease is never so nigh at hand‚' i. e. there is no more
effectual remedy. Kennedy renders it ‘their toils have no more
prompt success,' and this gives a more natural sense both to
laborum (in reference to the troublesome methods enjoined), and
to fortuna, i. e. the successful result of those methods. For prae-
sens=‘ready to aid,' ‘effectual‚' cp. ‘praesentia numina‚’ 1. 10,
also ‘present help,' Psalm 46. Ι.

453, 454. potuit, either ‘has the skill’ (Kt.)‚ or ‘has the
courage ’ to perform a serious operation. rescindere, &c.‚ ‘to lance
the head of the festering sore.’ tegendo, ‘by concealment,’=a
verbal substantive. Cp. Lucr. 4. 1068 ‘ulcus enim virescit et in-
veterascit alendo?

456. meliora omina, ‘ better signs,’ i. e. symptomS. The moral
is illustrated in the proverb ‘Heaven helps those who help them—
selves‚' and in the old fable of Hercules and the VVaggoner. C.
aptly quotes Soph. Aias 581 οὐ πρὸς ἰατροῦ σοφοῦ θρηνεῖν ἐπῳδὰς
πρὸς τομῶντι πήματι, ‘a wise leech mutters not charms over a sore
that needs the knife.' [For the reading omniaz‘all prosperity,'
see Various Readings.]

457. balantum; see on ‘volitans,' l. 147. Here, as in Ι. 272,
the term is emphatie, since the sheep bleat when in pain.

459, 460. profuit, ‘it has been sound' or ‘has proved usefu1.'
Cp. Ι. 84 ‘ steriles incendere profuit agros.' inter ima pedis, ‘in
the cleft of the hoof‚’ the part most easily reached by the knife.
salientem, ‘throbbing‚' properly said os the blood ‘bounding’ in
the vein.

461, 462. The Bisaltae dwelt upon the river Strymon in Thrace.
The Geloni (2. 1155 were a Scythian tribe, near the Borysthenes
(Dnieper). The Getae also dwelt in Scythia further west (4. 463).
Hence Rhodopen (1. 351 n.) refers to the Bisaltae and deserta
Getarum to the Geloni, though fugit, strictly speaking, has
Gelonus alone for its subject. eum fugit is merely descriptive
=the Bisaltae, &c., ‘who rove' the plains.

463. For this custom, attributed to various savage tribes and
related also of the modern Tartars, cp. Hor. Od. 3. 4. 24 ‘laetum
equino sanguine Concanum)

464. quam, sc. ovem, = si quam. The antecedent does not
appear, the construction being changed (by anacoluthon) in l. 468
to ‘ culpam compesce,’ instead of hanc occide. procul, ‘apart,' not
