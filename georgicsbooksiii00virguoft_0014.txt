10 INTRODUCTJON.

patriotic feeling which is so conspicuous in the Georgics. His
ideal of sels-contained philosophie contemplation is inconsistent
with one of active work, undertaken for the good of others or of
one's country. Such sentiments as Virgil has expressed in his
Praise of Italy in the Second Georgic, or his conception of the
world doing homage to the majesty of Rome, are alien to Lucre-
tius' idea of history, for whom contemporary events are but
transient and incidental, as compared with the infinity of Nature
ancl the immutability of her laws.

As regards metre and versification, Virgil may fairly be said
to have brought to perfectiori the instrument which Lucretius
had already more than halffashioned. Since the time of Ennius
(239—169 B. C.) the Latin hexameter had passed through succes-
sive stages of progress, until in Lucretius Virgil found a starting—
point whence he was enabled to reach a height of excellence
that admitted of no further advance. Hence, although many
lines in the Georgics recall the rhythm of corresponding passages
in the de Rerum Nasum, the general effect is dissimilar. For
instance, Lucretius often ends a verse with words of five syl-
lables, as principiorum, materiai, or of four, as animaz'3 Virgil
never admits the former ending, except in the case of the proper
name Deiopea (G. iv. 343), and the latter only in Greek words
like kyacsnslms, cusparissis, etc. Lines without a caesura in the
second foot‚ as ‘ Religionibus atque,’ etc„ ‘Aut extrinsecus aut,'
etc„ are rare in Virgil, and always used for the sake of effect ¹.
A spondee in the fifth foot is far oftener introduced by Virgil,
following Homer and Hesiod, than by Lucretius, who does not
as a rule imitate Greek rhythms. Alliteration, or repetition of
similar consonantS, and assonance, or recurrence of the same
vowel-sounds, abound in the poem of Lucretius, but are less
frequent in the Geor-gics, though several instances occur².
