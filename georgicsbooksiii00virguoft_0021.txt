the poets, when they echoed the popular voice, did so from sin-
· cerity of conviction.’ At the present crisis men naturally turned
to Octavian as a visible object of reverence, as a sort of incar-
nation of that divine providence on which the destinies of the
empire depended. Add to this the prevalent belief in apotheosis,

or the admission after death os the souls of heroes to the com-
pany of the gods, and we have the materials out of which a

poet’s highly-wrought enthusiasrn might shape such an expres-
sion of eulogy as the famous tuque adeo passage, where Augustus
is invoked as the ruler of earth and sea and sky and the worthy
recipient of human vows and prayers. But although the gene-
ral tone of this invocation may thus be accounted for and in
some measure excused, we feel that Virgil has exceeded reason-
able limits when he indulges in such imaginations as Tethys
buying Augustus as a son-in-law with the dowry of all her
waves, the Scorpion making room for him as a new sign in
the Zodiac, and the possible desire on his part of super—
seding Pluto as lord of the realms of Tartarus. To us such ex-
travagant expressions of language must always appear unreal
and overstrained‚ inconsistent alike with the good sense, truth-
fulness and dignity of a great poet.

For the text of Virgil we are mainly indebted to the four great
uncial MSS. (written in capitals)‚ dating from the fourth and
fifth centuries A. D. These arez—(1) and (2) the Vatican (F)
and the Palatina (P), in the Vatican Library at Rome, estimated
the best authorities; (3) the llffedz‘cean (M), in the Laurentian
Library at Florence3 (4) the Roman (R), also in the Vatican
Library‚ but of inferior value. The third (M) is the only MS.
that contains the whole of the Georgics. In P. the lines from
G. i. 323 to ii. 139, and the conclusion of the Fourth Book, in R.
from ii. 2—215 and iv, 37-180‚ are wanting 3 while F. contains only
some portions of the Third and Fourth Books. All these are
probably derived from one original copy, representing a much
older authority than any we now possess.
