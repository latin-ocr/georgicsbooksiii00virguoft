‘still.’ inscius aevi is variously rendered as (1) ‘ignorant in
youth' (gen. of respect), like ‘integer aevi‚' A. 2. 6383 (2) ‘ignorant
of life,' i. e. inexperienced, like ‘ venturique inscius aevi,' Α. 8. 6273
τ’ 3) ‘ unconscious of his youthful strength.’ Either of the two latter
renderings are to be preferred to the first; the last agrees with one
of the points in Rarey's system noticed above.

190. tribus exactis, abl. absolute, ‘when he has completed his
third year) With accesserit, sc. pullo (dative). Is born in the
spring, he would be entering on his ‘ fourth summer.'

191. carpere gyrum, ‘pace the ring.' Cp. l. 115 n. Colts

man standing in the middle, as with us.

192. compositis, ‘ regular‚' in measured time. sinuetque, &c-
‘bend into an arch alternately,' lit. ‘arch the alternate bendings!
Cp. l. 117. Xenophon, Περὶ Ἱππικῆς 2. 7, uses the descriptive term
διατροχάζειν, ‘to make two wheels' or ‘hoops' with his legs, as a
trotting horse does, and this answers to Virgil's description.

193. laboranti—implies restraint, as contrasted with natural
voluntary movement. similis, ‘with the air' or ‘appearance of,’
&c. Cp. ⁴ anhelanti similis,' A. 5. 254.

Aeneas vocat, et vocet oro.'

196. qualis, sc. volat or similar verb from the preceding passage.
This incomplete construction is common in similes beginning with
qualis cum or ubi, the correlative talis being sometimes supplied,
but often omitted. The Hyperborei (l. 381, 4. 517), ’Τπερβόρεοι,
were supposed to inhabit the extreme northern regions, ‘ beyond the
North wind! densus, probab1y=‘f1erce and strong,’ with con·

cubuere mari‚⁷ Α. 1. 84.

197,198. arida differt nubila, ‘scatters the rainless clouds)
Aquilo is always a clearing wind; hence Ovid, Met. 1. 262, repre-
sents Jove as imprisoning this and the other dry winds before letting
loose the Deluge. Cp. ⁴ claro Aquilone,’ 1. 460. campi natantes,
⁴ floating plains‚' a Lucretian phrase for the sea. So ‘ campos
liquentes,' A. 6. 724.

199. lenibus, ‘ smooth ’ and ‘ steady,’ rather than ‘ gentle ’; corre-
sponding to the smooth easy pace of the horse not yet at full speed.
The rising storm is marked, first by steady gales bending the corn
and ruffling the surface of the water3 next comes the rustling of
tree tops and the long breakers driving shorewards 3 lastly‚ the storm
wind (Aquilo) in his sury.
