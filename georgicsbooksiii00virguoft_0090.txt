NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

200. longi fluetus, κύματα μακρά in Hom. Il. 2. 144, whence
this passage is partly imitated.

201. ille is emphatic,=Aquilo in full force. Note the dactylic
rhythm expressing the speed of the rushing wind.

202. hio, i. e. ‘such a horse as this,' referring back to 1. 195.
Cp. ‘hunc‚' l. 95. For Elei metas, the race-course at Olympia,
see on ll. 19, 180.

203. spatia, ‘rounds' or ‘laps' of the course (1. 513 n.).

204. molli, ‘docile‚' as in A. 11. 622 ‘mollia colla reflectunt!
The esseda (a Celtic word) are mentioned by Caesar as British
war-chariots, and were probably used also by the Belgae in Gaul.
[As the Romans had adopted the essedum in the form osa light chaise
for the use of the wealthier classes, it has been thought that Virgil
here refers to high bred horses employed to draw these carriages.
But the previous twofold division of the objects for which a horse is
bred, either for racing or war, is decidedly in favour of the former
view.]

205, 206. farragine, ‘mash‚' composed of spelt (sarra) with
barley and vetches, &c. Take crassa with creseere, ‘wax big,'
also ingentes with tollent (207), ‘ raise high.' For this ¹ proleptic ’
