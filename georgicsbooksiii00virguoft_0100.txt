NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

night over the vast expanso of plain, tlze herdsman carrying everytlzing
with him, like a Roman soldier on tlze marck. Far otherwise is it in
Scyllzia and tlte extreme regions of tlte nortlz. In tlzose elimes there
is no pasturage, and the cattle are kept in their stalls. lee snow
lies deep : all tlte year round frost and icy winds prevail ancl impene-
trable gloom. Frozen rivers bear waggons on their su7face,· wine
fi-eezes andponds become solid ice. C attle are buried deep in snow-
drifts ; deer are not lcunted, but slauglztered where tlzey stand,
lluddled together in tlte frozen mass. T lte nativas live in caverm
undmground by lzugefires, passing tlze ledious time in drinking and
sport. Such is tlte lise of tlze savage tribes of tlte north.

339. In Libyae the allusion is to the wandering or ‘nomad'
tribes (νομάδες) of the Numidae and Gaetuli in northern Africa.

340. raris . . . tectis, lit. ‘huts inhabited in seattered dwell—
ings,' a camp or settlernent composed of scattered huts; the abl.
tectis denoting the mode or conditions of habitation. Cp. A. 3. 13
‘terra procul vastis colitur Mavortia campis‚’ i. e. a district consist-
ing of wide plains. The mapalia (‘m5,galia’ in A. 1. 421) were
made of light wood or reeds, and are described by Sallust‚sug. 18,
as ‘ oblong huts with bulging sides, like the hulls of ships?

341-343. ex ordine, day after day, ‘a whole month together.’
Cp. ‘totos ex ordine menses‚' of successive months, 4. 501. hos-
pitiis, ‘ testing-place’ or ‘ settled abode.’

344. The armentarius (βουκόλος) kept the oxen while grazing‚
as distinguished from the bubulcus, who looked after them when
harnessed to a plough or cart. Larem-:⁴ his home‚’ of which, to a
Roman, the Lares on his hearth were the visible symbol. So in 4. 43
it is said of the bees ‘ fovere larem?

Observe the rhythm of this and the preceding line, expressing rapid
sweeping motion over the vast expanse of plain. The effect is pro—
duced, (1) by skilsul alternation of dactyls with spondees, (23 by the
full pause aster iacet in the fourth foot, (3) by the long stretclzing
word armentarius, terminating the second foot without any caesura.
(See footnote on p. 10 of Introduction.)

345. Amyclaeum=Spartan (l. 89 n.). The Laconian breed of
hounds was celebrated gl. 405), also the archery of Crete. Cres·
sam, from Κρῆσσα, sem. of Κρῆς, used as an adjective. The epithets
here are purely ‘literary' (see on l. 12), and not strictly appropriate
to a Numidiam herdsman.

347. iniusto, ‘enormous ' or ‘ cruel‚' from the notion of excess,
