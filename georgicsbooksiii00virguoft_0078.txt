NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

45. vox assensu, &c.‚ ‘the cry by eehoing groves redoubled
rings back.'

46. accingar, ‘gird myself'=‘essay,’ and therefore takes the
infinitive instead of the usual gerund with ad. >The poets use the
infin. freely after verbs of attempting‚ exhorting, persuading, entreat-
ing, &c. [Note also the construction, after Greek usage, of accingi
with the accusative in A. 4. 493 ‘ magicas accingier arte-0³3]

The poet now states explicitly what he had previously expressed
in allegorical language: his promise was afterwards fulfilled in the
Aeneid, though (as C. observes) in amanner and method different
from anything that is here suggested.

48. Tithonus was descended from Ilus, the brother of Assaracus,
and was therefore not in the direct line from Dardanus. See on
1. 35. But virgil is speaking of Trojan ancestors generally.

49-71. For lweedz'ng horscs ον oxen be carcful in your clzoz’ce of
dams. A good [ow should have evm‘ytlzz'ng, tlze feet included, on
a large scale, with crumpled lzorns ami shaggy ears ,· inlractable to tlze
yolee, osgood hcrgrlzt, her mil sweepz'ng the ground. T he best agefor
hreedz'ng z'sfrom four to ten years. h’rced early ; al any time dz'scase
ον death may come, there-’fore renew your stock conlz'nually from year to
year.

49, 50. For the chariot-races at Olympia see note on 1. 19.
miratus =‘ coveting.’ Take ad aratra with sortes, and cp. ‘ fortis
aratris,’ 1. 62.

For the following directions virgil is indebted to his predecessor
Varro (Introd. p. 7). It should be observed that in ancient Italy
cattle were bred prineipally for drauglzt purposes, not for meat:
hence strength and size are the all-important qualities in the cow,
since the calves take after their mothers.

51, 52. torvae, ‘grim.' turpe, ‘unsightly’ i.e. ‘coarse.’ Cp.
‘turpes phocas‚’ 4. 395. plurima, ‘ massive‚' thick and long.

54. tum, ‘ next,' marking a fresh point in the description, as in
2. 2 6.

53. etiam, ‘even ³ or ‘ as well‚’ in contradiction to Varro, who
says ‘ pedibus non latis.’ camuris, ‘ curving inwards‚' what we call
‘ crumpled horns.’

56, 57. maculis et albo, probably a lzendz‘adys, ‘dappled with
white spots? See note on ‘ pateris et auro' = ‘ golden bowls,’ 2. 192.
detractans, ‘ refusing,' or ‘ shy of' the yoke. aspera, ‘ dangerous,'
‘ misehievous,' i. e. prone to goring, a sign of spiritedness.

58, 59. tauro propior, the same point as denoted by ‘torvae‚'
