167. libera makes a verbal antithesis to servitio. It may be
taken either as ‘free-bom‚’ or in reference to the looseness of the
collar, which leaves the neck comparatively ‘ free.'

168, 169. ipsis torqujbuS, ‘the sels-same eollars,' i.e. the cir-
culi above mentioned. At first the calves are to wear the twig
collars separate1y‚ next they are to be yoked ‘in pairs’ by a cord
sastened to the collars. aptos, for aptatos, ‘harnessedss Keightley
has collected a number of similar instances, as orbus, cruentus,
decorus, δια, for the corresponding participles. gradum con-
ferre, ‘ to step together.’ Ι

170. illis, dat. of agent. Cp. ‘habitae Grais oracula quercus‚'
2. 16. rotae inanes, ‘ empty wains‚' the primitive plaustrum con-
sisting of two wheels joined by an axle, on which boards were placed
(K). So Varro recommends ‘ ut inania primum ducant plaustra.’

171. vestigia, according to C. are the ‘tracks’ or ‘ruts' of the
wheels, keeping rotae as subject of signent. But, as Kennedy
observes, illis ducantur = illi ducant, so that iuvenci may very well
be the subject, and vestigia their ‘ footprints.‘

172. From Hom. Il. 5. 838 με”γα δ’ ἔβραχε φήγινος ἄξων. The
labouring rhythm expresses weight and difficulty.

173. iunctos orbes, ‘ wheels sastened' to the pole (temo).
neren-5», ⁴ bronze-plated ' ; this would increase the weight.

174. indomitae, while yet ‘unbroken.’ This refers back to an
earlier stage, before the training begins.

175. vescas, ‘meagre‚' ‘poor,' as probably in 4. 151, where see
note. [The accepted meaning of vescus was ‘ small '; cp. Ov. Fast.
3. 446 ⁶ vescaque parva vocant.' It was supposed to be from ve and
επακ( ill-nourished' or ‘ ill-nourishing,' and this derivation, whether
true or not, must have affected the use of vescus as applied to edible
plants or to animals, as ‘ corpore vesco‚' Pliny, N. H. 7. 81. 111
Lucr. 1. 326 ‘vesco sale' means either ‘ fine spray,' or spray that
slowly eats away the rocks. The prefix ve-, the exact definition of
which is disputed, appears to be used in a depreciatory sense, de-
noting either excess or defect. Hence vegrandz's, when used of
crops or grain (which ought to be large) would be understood to
mean ‘ small’ or ‘p00r.' See Ovid, Fasti 1. c.] For willow leaves
as food for cattle cp. 2. 435.

176. frumenta sata, ‘growing corn‚' either in the blade or the
ear. fetae, after calving.

177. more patrum. “ People in the earliest ages lived much
upon milk, and therefore defrauded their calves os a great part of
their natural nourishment. This practice Virgil condemns” (Martyro-
