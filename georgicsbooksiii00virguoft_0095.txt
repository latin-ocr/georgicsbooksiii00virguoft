BOOK [Π. 2 58—283.

Ida. Similar plurals, from a singular in —us, forming convenient
dactyls, are Illamala. 1. 17, Tartara, 1. 36, Ismara, 2. ²7· The As—
cam'us was a river of Bithynia.

271. continuo ubi, &c., ⁸ when once the flame has kindled.' See
on l. 75. With subdita sc. est as in l. 235. For the ‘marrow,’ re-
presenting the inmost parts, the seat of passion, cp. A. 4. 68 ‘est
mollis flamma medullas,‘ 8. 389 ‘medullas Intravit calor et labefacta
per ossa cucurrit.’

275. vento gravidae. This strange theory is asserted by
Aristotle‚ Hz'st. Am'm. 6. 18, under the term ἑξανεμοῦσθαι, also by
Varro and Columella of mares in Spain. It appears to have been
generally accepted.

276. The spondaic ending, following the dactyls, expresses sudden
downward motion. So Homer, Il. 4. 74, describes the swift descent
of Athene, βῆ δὲ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων ἀΐξασα.

277, 278. Aristotle says ‘ they run neither to the east nor to tlze west,
but to the north and south.‘ virgil says either ⁶ not to the east nor
to the north or south ³ (if que be disjunctive, continuing the negation),
or else ‘not to the east but to the north or south) which is perhaps
the better rendering. In either case he omits the west, supposing the
mares to be standing on a western cliff (l. 273), whereas Aristotle,
speaking of Crete, which stretches lengthwise from east to west,
makes them run northward or southward, that being the nearest
directionvto the sea coast.

According to Pliny Eurus is the S. E. wind, Boreas the N. E„
Caurus the N. W., and Auster the S. wind. The last is termed
‘ nigerrimus,' also in Α. 5. 696, bringing clouds and rain. Cp. 4. 261,
also ‘ Iuppiter umidus Austris,' 1. 418.

280. hiez‘then‚’ i. e. at this stage of their passion. demum
often emphasises adverbs of time, as tum demum (ἐνταῦθα δή), ‘ then
and not before.' vero nomine probably means ‘rightly so named,’
from its maddening effects on horses. Or ‘truly named’ in dis-
tinction to another hippomanes, viz. an excrescence on the sorehead
of a soal, which the mother was said to devour. This is alluded
to in A. 4. 514 as ‘matri praereptus am0r‚’ and was also used in
magic rites. Besides these Theocritus, 2. 48, mentions aplant called
ἱππομανές, which had the same properties.

282, 283. The wickedness of step—mothers, in making away with
children by a former marriage to secure the inheritance for their
own, was proverbial. Hence the epithets ‘ malae,’ ‘ saevae,’ 2. 128,
whence 1. 283 is repeated. For miscuerunt. cp. ‘tuleruntss Ε. 4.
61, also dedirunt, stetessrzmt, διο. non innoxia, ‘ baleful,‘ a litotes,
like ‘ illaudati,’ l. 5.
