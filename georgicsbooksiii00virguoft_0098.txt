NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

dyed would ‘ setch a high price? Hence Virgil means that goats are
as profitable as sheep, though the best wool is very valuable. The
Tyrian purple dye is well known. rubores, acc. after the passive
verb in middle sense, imitated from the Greek. See on 4. 337, 482,
and cp. E. 1. 106 ‘ inscripti nomina regum‚' A. 4. 137 ‘ chlamydem
circumdata‚' among a number of instances.

308. hinc, i.e. ex capris. Goats commonly bear twins, some-
times triplets, and supply milk enough for rearing their young and
for home consumption as well.

309, 310. quam magis . . . (tam) magiS, instead of the usual
quo . . . eo. The literal sense is ‘the more milk you take at the
first milking,the greater will be the yield at the next ' ; i. e. however
much you have already taken, there will be plenty more to come.
For the poetical epithet laeta, here==‘ copious,‘ ‘rich,' see note
on 1. 1.

312. tondent, sc. pastores. Cp. ll. 124, 128. hirei is the gen.
sing. [Some make it the nom. pl., understanding tondent as
poetieally equivalent to tonderi sinunt3 cp. ‘dant arbuta silvae,'
2. 520. The chief objection is that caprae, not hirci, are the subject
of pascuntur and the following verbs, down to l. 317.] The
district about the Cinyps, a river of northern Libya, was famous for
its breed of goats.

313. Cloths made of goats' hair were used sor tent—coverings and
for coarse sailors' jackets. Note the sympathetic touch in the epithet
miseris, ‘poor sailors ' (πολυπόνοις).

314. pascuntur, being transitive in sense, takes an accusative as in
l. 458, 4. 181. Lycaei is put for any mountain range, but specifies
the Arcadian haunt of Pan (1. 2 n.)-

316. ipsae=sp0nte, as in 2. 10, 459 and elsewhere. Cp. E. 4. 21
⁴ ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae ubera.' suos, ‘their
young)

317. The pause aster the spondee ducunt expresses the slow pace
of the milk-laden goats. The same metrica] device is used else-
where to denote weight, closeness, διο. Thus in l. 375 ‘caedunt ’
indicates the thrust of the knise, ‘ stipant ' (4. 164), the bees paeking
honey in cells, ¹ tollunt ' (4. 196), the effort of rising with a load.

318, 319. ergo, &c., i.e. since sor the rest of the year they need
but little care, do not grudge them the little they do require in the
cold season. mortalis = humanae, as distinguished from the lower
animals. By some writerS, e.g. Sallust, ‘mortales ’ is regularly used
for homines.

320. virgea refers to the twigs of the arbutus mentioned in 1. 301.—
laetus =lz'l1ens, ‘ ungrudgingly,' i. e. with liberal hand.
