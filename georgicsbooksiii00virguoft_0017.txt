JNTRODUCTION. 13

which Virgil had in common with Lucretius has been already
noticed. It naturally pervades the Third Book, which treats of
, horses and cattle, while the Fourth is one continued description
of the state and habits of bees, in language drawn from human
politics and society.

But nowhere are V irgil’s powers of description more strikingly
shown than in the episodes and digressions which from time to
time break the continuity of his didactic exposition. Such are
the grand storin-piece (i. 316), the charming description ofspring
(ii. 323), of the chariot-race (iii. 103), of the combat of bulls
(iii. 219), of the battle of the bees in swarming—time (iv. 67), of
the garden plot of the old Corycian swain (iv. 125) ; besides the
longer digressions:——a Scythian winter scene (iii. 349), the
murrain among cattle in Noricum (iii. 478), and the story of
Aristaeus ¹, which occupies nearly half of the Fourth Book.

Three of the longer episodes are deeply imbued with that
patriotic feeling which distinguishes Virgil as the national poet
of his time. The first (i.464 to the end of the Book) enumerates
the direful portents following upon the assassination of Julius
Caesar. These he regards as tokens of divine wrath for a
national crime, and he ends with a prayer for the safety of
Octavian, who alone could restore the fallen fortunes of Rome.
The second (ii. 136, etc.) celebrates the praises of Italy—‘ great
mother of fruits‚ great mother of men '—in noble lines which
overflow with affection for his native land. In the third episode
(ii. 475 to the end) Virgil enthusiastically depicts his ideal of
rural joys and innocence, as contrasted with the vices and rest-
less ambition of the court and the camp, and concludes with
a longing backward glauce at the ‘life of yore the antique
Sabines lived,' and the glories of the Golden Age.

¹ This was not included in the first edition of the Georgics. We
learn from Servius that Vix-gil had introduced an eulogy of his friend
Cornelius Gallus, who was governor of Egypt in 28 B.C. But aster
Gallus had fallen into disgrace with the emperor and committed suicide,
the episode of Aristaeus was substituted by the command of Augustus.
