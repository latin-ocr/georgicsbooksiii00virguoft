NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

clause. ipse=‘generally,’ i. e. the whole ram as distinguished
from the part (his tongue). For the distinctive force of ipse see
note on l. 129.

388--390. Aristotle, Pliny, and others attest the fact of the colour
of the ram’s tongue affecting that of the lamb's wool. But Pliny
says that the Tarentine wool was admired for its darker tinge.
pleno eampo, ‘the teeming plain ’ gives the idea of prosperity and
abundance.

391—393. According to one version of the story, borrowed from
Nicander (Introduction, p. 6), Pan enticed the Moon-goddess to
follow him by the present of a white—fleeced ram out of his flock.
captam fefellit, ‘ lured and beguiled.'

394. cytisum, a kind of shrubby lucerne, mentioned E. 9. 31
as a milk—producing food for cows;—‘ sic cytiso pastae distendant
ubera vaccae.' lotos. This, the Melilotus, is an herbaceous plant.
distinct from the lotus, or jujube tree, mentioned in 2. 84. There
was a third kind, the aquatic lotus, or water—lily.

395. ipse implies that he is not to leave the task to others, since
it is a matter of importanee (Q). Cp. the thrice repeated ‘ipse,'
4. 112—114. salsas, ‘ salted,⁷ at least in cases where the herbage
is not naturally salt.

396. hinc, ‘ by this means,' expressing the effect.

398. etiam excretos, se. a matre, ‘at their very birth '3 from
excerno, not excresco.

399. prima, probably adverbial=‘srom the first.' [But it may
mean the front, i. e. extremity of their mouths] praefigunt ora
capistris = praefigunt oribus capistra, by a not uncommon in-
version. Cp. l. 140 n. ; also ‘ suffuderit ore ruborem‚' ῐ. 430. The

400—403. The meaning (with the present text, but see Various
Readings) is that the morning milk is made into curds or cheese;
the evening milk, similarly treated, is taken to market next morning,
or salted and stored up for home consumption. The last line (403)
probably refers to all the milk, though said, for brevity, only of
that drawn in the evening. The aut, δίε. may mean that a portion
only is sold, and the rest kept in store.

For premunt, cp. ‘ pressi copia lactis,’ E. 1. 81, also ‘ premeretur
caseus urbi‚’ z‘b. 35. contingunt (from tango) = ‘give it a dash of
salt.'

Daubeny observes there were two kinds of cheese‚ one soft, which
would not keep more than a few days, the other hard, which would
last a long time. Milk aster coagulating was put into baskets
