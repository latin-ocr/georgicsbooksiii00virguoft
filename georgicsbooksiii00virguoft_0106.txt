NOTES TO THE GEORGICS.

416. immotis, ‘undisturbed‚' ‘neglected‚’ i.e. not eleaned out.
mala tactu, ‘ dangerous to handle ’ (lit. ‘in the handling').

417. eaelum, ‘light of day! For the perfect delituit, διο.
(aorists of custom), cp. ll. 365, 378 n.

418. coluber, a larger kind of snake, not precisely identified.
[The root col-‚ akin to πόλ-ος, πέλ-ω, indicates turning or winding
about]

420. fovit humum, ‘hugs the ground.’ Cp. 4. 43 ‘sub terra
fovere larem ’ (speaking of bees), A. 9. 57 ‘castra fovere?

421. minas, ‘its threatening crest.’ The line is repeated with
variations in A. 2. 581 ‘attollentem vias et caerula colla tumen-
tem!

423, 424. Originally (l. 421) the snake lay coiled up, with head
erect and hissing ; now its head is thrust into a hole, its middle and
hinder parts are unwinding, only the ‘last fold’ of his tail still
‘drags out its lingering coils.' agmina, properly a line in motion,
is again used of a serpent's ⁴ train' in A. 2. 212 ⁶ agmine certo‚’ ib.
5. 90 ‘ agmine longo.’

425. ille=‘that well-known snake.' Cp. 4. 71 n.‚ also A. 10.
704 ‘ac velut ille . . . actus aper.⁷ This snake was called Chersy-
drus (χέρσος, ὕδωρ), being amphibious.

428. rumpuntur=se rumpunt, ‘ burst forth.'

430, 431. hic, i.e. in or near the pools. improbus: ‘ insatiate,’
‘ voracious’ ; from the notion of excess,pr0bus implying moderatiori.
Cp. ‘improbus anser‚’ 1. 119. ingluviem, ‘maw‚’ properly a
bird's crop.

434. Several editors quote Sallust, jugurtha, e. 89 ‘ natura ser-
pentium, ipsa perniciosa, siti magis quam alia re accenditur) ex-
territus, a forcible word, lit. ‘dismayed,' i. e. ‘frantie ' or ‘dis-
tracted.'

435, 436. ne libeat, ‘may 1 never take a fancy’ (C). dorso
nemoriS, ‘the wooded ridge os a hill.’ Cp. ‘praerupti nemoris
dorso‚’ Hor. Sat. 2. 6. 91.

437-439. Repeated A. 2. 473, 475. positis exuviis„ ‘ having
cast his slough.’ This process, according to Aristode, Hz'st. Anim.
8. 17, took place twice a year, in spring and autumn.

438. catulos aut ova, perhaps refers to different kinds of
serpents, some being viviparous, others oviparous. The Chersy·
drus belongs to the latter class. But in any case there is an
error in fact, since serpents take no care of their young after
hatching.

439. linguis, abl. of instrument, ore, a local abhrtive, ‘ with its
tongue, in the mouth.' For micat. see on l. 84. trisulcis, Cp. Ovid‚
