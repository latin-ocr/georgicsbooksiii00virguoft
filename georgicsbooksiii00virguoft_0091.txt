BOOK HJ. 200-234.

212—214. relegant, sc. magistri. It was the legal term for
banishment. See on 1. 225. oppositum, ⁴ intervening‚' so as to
prevent his seeing her. satura=saturata‚ ‘well stored’ with
fodder. Cp. ‘ saturi Tarenti‚' 2. 197.

215. carpit uritque, ‘wastes and consumes.’ Cp. Hor. Od. 1.
19. 5 ‘ urit me Glycerae nitor.' videndo, ‘by the sight of her' (CA.

217. dulcibus, &c. in connexion with the preceding sentence,
‘so sweet are her allurements.’ illa is emphatic, like ‘illae' in
2. 435, ‘multum ille . . . iactatus,’ A. 1. 3, ‘aut ille sinistra,' 5.
457. Here the emphasis is strengthened by quidem, as in l. 501.

219. Sila (restored for the old reading silva from the similar
passage in A. 12. 715, διε.) was a large pine forest in the territory of
the Bruttii in the extreme south of Italy.

221. lavit, from lavffrc (cp. Hor. Od. 3. 12. 2), is the regular form
of the 3rd sing. in Virgil. Cp. l. 359, A. 3. 663, 10. 727.

223. longus Olympus, ‘the broad sky‚' is a translation of μακρὸς
Ολυμπος in the Iliad, though Homer means the actual Mount Olympus,
on whose summit the gods were supposed to dwell.

224. una stabulare, ‘to stall together‚' bellantes being the
subject. Stabulare, here as in A. 6. 286, is intransitive, for stabulari,
which Virgil does not use.

225—228. The metaphor is political, as in ‘relegant,⁷ l. 212.
As Keightley observes, we are reminded of some old Roman going
into exile, galled at the success of his rival, and looking back upon
the Capitol as he departs. ignominia was the regular term for
political disgrace.

227. amoreS, ‘his love,’ commonly used in the plural of the
object of one's affection. So ‘ delicias‚' as in E. 2. 2.

228. The perf. excessit, denotes sudden or instantaneous action,
‘ he is gone ' at once. Cp. ‘ fugere‚' 1. 330, ‘ exiit,’ 2. 81, ‘ petiere‚' 2.
210.

230. pernox, ‘ all night long.’ [For the other reading pernix
see list of Various Readings.] instrato, if taken in its usual sense
as the past part. of insterno, can only mean ‘spread on them ’ (the
rocks). But this would be a most awkward construction, and there is
little doubt that Virgil intended it sor an adjective, ‘unstrewn’ or
‘bare'z perhaps (as C. suggests) wishing to translate the Greek
ἄστρωτος.

231. carice, ‘ sedge ’ or hard rusb, as distinct from iuncus, which
is either the ‘ bulrush’ or a general term for all kinds (Kt.).

232-234. These lines are repeated in Α. 12. 104—106. irasci
in cornua, an expressive phrase translated from Eur. Bacchae 743
εἷς κέρας θυμούμενοι, ‘gather his wrath into his horns,’ regarded as
