GRAMMATICAL ΛΝΒ RHETORICAL.

Hendiadys (ἓν διὰ δυοῖν), one notion conveyed by two nouns
coupled by a conjunction (et or que). It may be equivalent (1) to an
adjective and substantive, as ‘ maculis et albo' 3. 57, or (2) to a
noun with another in the genitive case, as perhaps ‘ fuco et floribus ’
4. 39 (see note), or (31η to two nouns in apposition, where the latter
noun explains the former, as ‘armenta et phocas’ 4. 395.

Litotes (‘ smoothing down,' from λιὲνός, akin to λειός, ‘ smooth ’)
or Meiosis (‘lessening‚' from μείων), an understatement of the {act
by the use of a milder form of expression; as ‘ illaudati‘ 3. 5, ‘ in-
amabilis ’ 4. 479.

Prolepsis (προλαμβάνειν), an anticzjffiatz'on os the effect of the verb
by an adjective, apparently put as an epithet with the object of the
said verb3 as ‘ sulcos oblimet inertes ' 3. 136, ⁶ frigida tecta relin-
quunt' 4. 104.

Zeugma (ζευγνύναι), the joining of two nouns with a verb which
strictly suits only one of thern, but suggests another verb of similar
meaning to be supplied with the remaining noun 3 as ‘ vim duram et
vincula tende ' 4. 599.

PRosomAL.

Arsis (αἴρειν, ¹ to raise ⁷ the voice), the syllable in a soot on which
the stress or accent is laid, as car'mz'ne, men'les, or in two words
where the strong caesura occurs, as Palle's et l te' &c. The oppo-
site term 'rhesis (θεῖναι, ‘to set down,’ or ‘let fall' the voice)
denotes the weaker unaccented part of the foot, whether it be long
or short in actual quantity. Hence the accented syllables are said
to be in arsi, the unaceented in thesi. For examples see 3. 76,
