JNTRODUCTJON. 15

leading characteristics are distinctly Italian. All the details
apply to Italian modes of farming, and represent the best
methods then in vogue. This is amply attested by succeeding
writers on agriculture, notably by Pliny and Columella ¹, who on
the whole confirm Virgil’s statements‚ though differing from him
in a few minor points. The varieties also of scenery and
climate described in the picturesque portioris of the poem are
such as belong peculiarly to Italy. The mention of foreign
countries is introduced either by way of contrast (as in ii. 120,
etc.), or to remind his readers of the far reaching activity of
Roman commerce, which made Rome the emporium os all the
products of the world (i. 56, etc.). And not only these unchang-
ing features of earth and sky, but much of the habits and con—
ditioris of rural life and labour bear witness at the present day
to Virgil⁷s unfailing accuracy in description. As a living
writer observes :——‘ In the country of Virgil, in the land of the
Georgics, there is the poetry of agriculture still. The reaper
with his hook, the ploughman with his oxen, the girl who gleans
amongst the trailing vines, the men that sing to get a blessing
on the grape, all have a certain grace and dignity of the old
classic ways left with them. They till the earth with the sim-
plicity of old, looking straight to the gods for recompense.
Great Apollo might still come down amidst them, and guide
his milk—white beasts over their furrows, and there would be
nothing in the toil to shame or burden him.’ Nowhere indeed
is the national religious character of ancient Italy more vividly
set forth than in those passages of the Georgics which inculcate
the duty of worshipping the rural deities and the reverent ob-
servance of rites and festivals, as an indispensable condition

¹ Columella, who wrote about a century afterwards, follows virgil in
many particulars: e. g. on the choice of soils, drainage, faIIowing,
rotation os crops, cultivation of vines; cattle breeding and pasturage
for sheep and goats3 the economy of bees, the situation of hives, etc.
His tenth book on gardening, written in verse, was suggested by the
lines in G. iv. 116—124. Of Virgil himself he say5‚ ‘ Haec autem con-
sequemur, si verissimo vati, velut oraculo, crediderimus.¹
