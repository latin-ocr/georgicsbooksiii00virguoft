probable that Virgil did not long continue at Andes. The
liberality of Octavian and his minister Maecenas had secured
him leisure ancl comparative wealth‚ and we know from the con-
cluding lines of the Fourth Georgic that a little later he was
residing at NapleS. After completing the Eclogues, Virgil began
the Georgics in 37 or 36 B.C. ¹, at the suggestion of Maecenas,
who had now become his intimate friend and patron. The work
of composition occupied seven years²; this brings the date of
completion down to 29 Β. C.‚ in which year the poem 3 was read
aloud by Virgil and Maecenas alternately, to Augustus at Atella,
in Campania, on his final return to Italy after the settlement of
the Eastern provinces. The period (36-29 Β. C.) assigned to the
composition of the Georgics applies to the poems as a whole, but
some portions must have been written independently of their
present context, and afterwards inserted where we find thern.
Thus the conclusion of the First Book (498, etc.), with its gloomy
forebodings and desperate appeal to Caesar to save Rome from
destruction, cannot be of the same date with the introductory
invocation in which Octavian is hailed as a present deity and
protecting power. The former passage (perhaps also ii. 495—9)
may well be assigned to 33 B.C.‚ when Rome was harassed by
civil war, and her empire overrun by foreign enemies in the East
and West 4. The latter passage, together with the stately
exordium of the Third Book almost certainly belongs to 30 or
29 B.C., a time of public rejoicing, when, after his recent vic-
tories‚ Augustus celebrated a triple triumph and had divine
honours decreed to him.

The form of the Georgics is what is called ‘didactic,' i.e.‚
