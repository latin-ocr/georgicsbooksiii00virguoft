22 VARIOUS READINGS

202. The MSS. are divided between hie and hinc = ‘ after such a course
of training.' The former, which is the reading of the Palatine and the
Berne MSS„ is probably to be preferred. M. has hic corrected to hinc
by a later hand.

230. Most MSS. read pernix, which has been explained to mean
‘ obstinate ' or ‘ persevering.' But its only recognised meaning is ‘ swift '
(as in l. 93) ; and the reading pernox, found in some MSS„ is so much
better suited to the context, that it has been generally adopted.

²57- The Palafine, Roman, and some other codices read umerosque,
thus connecting atque hinc, &c. with fricat, the atque . . . atque being
equivalent to et . . . et. The reading in the text, found in the Medicean
and other MSS.. is preferable. (See note.)

305. haee . . . tuendae. This, which is the reading of the Vatican and
Roman MSS. is certainly the right one. The variant readings hae . . .
tuendae and haee . . . tuenda are obvious corrections of a supposed
error, made by transcribers who were ignorant of the fact explained in
the note.

398. Most MSS. and editions read iam for etiam. But the latter
reading rests upon valid authority, makes better rhythm and equally
good sense.

402. All the MSS. read exportant, as in text ; but Scaliger, to avoid
the parenthesis adit oppida pastor, proposed exportans. Kennedy
adopts this, and puts a semicolon after sub lucem, understanding premunt.
This completes the sense, but makes the sentence abrupt, and after all
leaves a parenthesis from exportans to pastor. It is Virgil's habit to con—
dense his descriptions and to avoid over much precision in details. See
Introduction, p. 11.

456. All MSS. with one unimportant exception read omnia. This
reading, if retained, finds its parallel in phrases like fausta omnia,
prospera omnia precari. But, as Conington observes, ‘no instance is
quoted for the combination ‘⁴ meliora omnia‚” and in any case omina is
less colloquial and more poetical.' The difference is so slight as to
make MS. authority of little value, and in several instances the words
omina and omnia have been confused ; eg. in A. 2. 182 ‘ita digerit omina
Calchas,' where of course there can be no doubt as to the right reading.

563. temptarat (tentarat) is the reading of two of the principal
Codices (Pal.and Rom.). The Medicean (M) has temptaret (altered to
temptarat byLa later hand), which-Ribbeck adopts.
