BOOK JV. 417—4 54.

441. miracula rerum, ‘ wondrous shapes.’

445, 446. nam quis (usually quisnam), ‘ who then ’ἐ ’ expressing
surprise. Cp. τίς -γάρ, πῶς γάρ, &c.‚ though in the corresponding pas-
sage, Od. 4. 462, Proteus begins with τίς νύ τοι. hino, = ‘ from me.’

447, 448. neque est . . . quiequam. Taking te as the object
of fallere, we may translate either (Ι) ‘ Thou knowest it of thyself
(without my tessing), to deceive thee a‘t all is impossible; cease
thou from thy attempt‚’ to elude me: or (2) ‘ Nor ean aught escape
thy notice; cease thou,’ &c. In the former case quiequam=‘in
any wise,’ adverbial accus. like τι; in the latter fallere has to be
taken in a slightly different sense in the two clauses, but the English
‘ escape' (=‘escape notice ' and ‘ elude ³) will fairly serve for both.
[Others take te as the subject of fallere, ‘thou can'st not deceive
me‚’ by pretending ignoranee (C), but this is less probable than
either, though the phrase is confessedly ambiguous] Virgil seems
to have had in his mind two separate lines of Homer, one in Od.
4. 465 οἶσθα, γέρον· τί με’ταῦτα παρατροπέων ἒρεεῖνεις; the other in
ll. 1. 365, where Achilles replies to Thetis' enquiry, what ailed him,
οἶσθα· τίη τοι ταῦτα ἰδυίῃ πάντ’ ἀγορεύω;

449. lassis rebus, ⁶ my jaded fortunes‚' cp. ‘ fessis rebus,' A. 3.
145. [For the other reading lapsis see Various Readings.] hino,
⁴ from thee,’ repeated from the question of Proteus, 1. 446.

450—452. vi multa, ‘by strong constraint‚' or ‘with mighty
effort‚’ expressing reluctance on the part of Proteus overcome by
superior force. intorsit, ‘rolled on him! glauco, the colour
regularly ascribed to sea deities; cp. ‘caeruleus,‘ l. 388. ‘Shot
forth the gray light of his gleaming eyes' (Rhoades). fatis may
be abl„ ‘ by fate's decree‚’ but is more probably dative, = ‘to declare
the fates‚’ i. e. the heaven-sent cause of Aristaeus' distress.

453-527. ‘It z‘s the vengeanse of Orpheus that pur-mes thee,
Orpheus wrolh sor his lost wiſse, whom in her flrgrht from thee a
serpent slew zmawares. The nymphi· bewailed her loss ,· Orpheus
himself, all dz'sconsolale, went down to Pluto's realms in quest os
her. By lzfs music he charmed the shades; the dread realms of
Tartarus felt its magic power. Thus Orpheus regaz'ned his bride ,·
but on llis earthwara' joztrney,f0rgelful <gf the condz'tions, he turned
to look upon her. She vanz'shcd wilh complaz'nz'ng cry, nor might he
return again to sech her. Alone, sor seven months he roamezl the
wilci regions (gf the north lmnenlz‘ng, as the mghtz'ugale laments her
lost younglings ‚· till at last the Thracian dames, jbr lzz's dmpz'tc of
them, tore him limb from [ὑπὸ ; and his head floating down the
Hebrus still repeated the name Eurydice.'

453, 454. non nullius, i. e. none other than a deity, in allusion
