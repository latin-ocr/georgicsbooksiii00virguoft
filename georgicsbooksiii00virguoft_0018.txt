This spirit of patriotism is indeed conspicuous throughout
the Georgics. ‘ It was natural ‘ (says Professor Sellar) ‘ that he
should, when his own fortunes were restored, . . . feel a stronger
and more disinterested sympathy with the public condition, at
a crisis to which no one could feel indifferent. It was natural
that his new relations should move him to undertake some work
of art more suited to his maturer faculty . . . . to write a poem
on a greater scale, and of more enduring substance, which at
the same time might serve to advance that policy of national
and social reorganisation which Caesar and his ministers were
anxious to promote. . . All Virgil’s early associations and sym-
pathies would lead him to identify himself with the interests
and happiness of such representations of the old rural life of
Italy as might still be found ¹) The insecurity produced by a
long period of civil war had caused a general neglect of agri-
culture in Italy. The veterans who had been settled upon the
lands of ejected colom' knew little or nothing of farming ². But
with the re-establishment of peace men felt that a new era was
dawning, and it was a marked feature of the policy of Augustus
and his minister Maecenas to promote the revival of that form
of industry, for which Italy under the republic had been so long
renowned. When therefore Virgil repaired to Rome, and had
come under the protection and patronage of the imperial court,
he eagerly devoted himself to a task for which he was qualified
alike by his genius and his practical experience. That Mae-
cenas may have suggested the undertakingss, we may easily
believe, but the existing state of affairs would naturally induce
Virgil, in his aspiration to become the national poet of Italy, to
make husbandry the theme of his song.

Hence, although the Georgics are professedly derived from
Greek originals, and are full of Greek literary associations, their
