NOTES ΟΝ THE GEORGICS.

204, 205. attrivere, dedere, present perfects (3. 246) = ‘have
been known to‚' &c. So ‘ rupere' 1. 213. ultro, ‘willingly’ or
‘free1y,' from the idea of going beyond (ultra) what is expected.
Cp. ll. 265, 530.

206, 207. ergo, &c., i. e. though the individual bees (ipsas) are
subject to accidents and short-lived, yet the racc is permanent.
excipiat, ‘awaits,' i. e. is destined for them. For the common
omission of quam after comparatives cp. E. 3. 105 ‘tres . . . non
amplius ulnas,' A. 1. 683 ‘ noctem non amplius unam.'

209. The terrn ‘ Fortuna urbis ' was used to designate the national
destiny of Rome. Virgil here uses it in reference to the bees, as he
had spoken of ‘ Quirites‚' 1. 201.

210, 211. non sie, i. e. ‘not so mueh.’ The mention of Egypt
was doubtless suggested by the recent defeat of Antony with
Cleopatra. ingens Lydia refers to the earlier dominion os
Croesus, under whom Lydia was really a ‘great empire.' The
Hydaspes was a tributary of the Indus, not a Median river,
so that the geography is, as usual, vague. Cp. l. 290; 2. 172,
465.

213, 214. For tense of rupere see on 1. 204. fidem, ‘bond of
sealty’ (Rhoades). mella here: ‘ cells,’ as shown by constructa.
crates favorum, ‘ wattled combs,’ from their basket-like form. C.
quotes Pindar, Pytlz. 6. 54 μελισσᾶν τρητὸν πόνον.

215-218. Cp. Phny, NH. 11. 17 ‘Mira plebi circa regem oboe-
dientia. Cum procedit, toturn examen cirea eum globatur, cingit,
protegit. . . Ipse opera intus circuit, similis exhortanti . . . Fessum
umeris sublevant.’ This last fact is also attested by Aristotle.

219-227. Hence some have deemed them to be inspirati by the
Dz'vine lllz'nd tlzat pervades the universe, whence all living creatures
‹lraw their origin and whitlzer all at last return.

220-222. This doctrine, derived from Pythagoras, is expounded
at length by Anchises to Aeneas in A. 6. 724—746. In that famous
passage, the ‘ spirit that inly nurtures ' all things, known as Anima
Asundi, is the divina mens here, and the haustus aetherios
⁵ draughts of (fiery) aether‚’ are referred to in the Aeneid, as ‘ aethe-
rium sensum atque aurai simplicis ignem.' It should be observed
that Virgil combines, 01· rather confuseS, two separate theories, first
saying that bees especially have this divine spirit, and then alleging
as a reason (namque) the fact that all creation is pervaded with it.
The former doctrine, as applied to the supposed soresight of birds,
he had already rejected in Ι. 415. See Introduction, p. 9.

222. This line is repeated from E. 4. 51. For the que before
tr see on 3. 385. caelum profundum is imitated by Gray in his
