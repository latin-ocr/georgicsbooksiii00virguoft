THE Georgics have justly been esteemed the most perfect and
artistic productiori of Virgil's genius. In his earlier essays in
verse, the Bucolics or Eclogues‚ the poet exhibits his wonder-
ful power over rhythrn and words, but we also detect in them
traces of the immaturity of youth, while their subjects are for the
most part confessedly light and trivial1. On the other hand the
Aeneid, owing to the vastness of its scope, forbade anything like
exhaustive treatment: moreover, it lacks the final touches of
the master's hand. But in the Georgics we have a work written
and perfected in the full maturity of the poet’s powers, It has a
serious purpose in view, and deals with a subject well suited to
his genius and inclination, so that, in spite of its unpromising
material, it is deservedly regarded as the most masterly com·-
position of its kind. Its principal defect in the eyes of modern
readers, that of oceasional obscursty, is due partly to causes
hereafter to be mentioned ², partly to lapse of time and

¹ The term ludere, applied by Virgii himself to these poems (E. i.
10; vi. 5; G. iv. 565) indicates this.
