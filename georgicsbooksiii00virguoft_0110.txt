Virgil's general description is modelled on that of the great plague
at Athens at the end of the 6th Book of Lucretius <Thuc. 2. 49, 501.
Compare also the account in Ovid, Met. 7. 523, &c., of the plague in
Aegina, and Lucan, Pharsalia 6. 80, &c.

478, 479. morbo caeli, ‘tainted air.' Cp. ζ morbidus aer' Lucr.
6. 1097 ; also A. 3. 137 (of the pestilence in Crete) ‘tabida membris.
Corrupto carli trasna, miserandaque venit . . . . lues et letifer
annus? tempestas. ‘ season‚' the autumn (August to Octoberss
being the most unhealthy time of year in those parts.

481. infecit tabo:‘ poisoned.’ The word tabum, properly de-
noting corrupted blood, is here applied to the juices of plants (Kt.).

482. simplex ‘ uniform.' i. e. the symptoms were various, and even
of an opposite character, as appears from the following description.

483. sitis expresses the effect of parching sever. So Lucretius
mentions ‘sitis arida‚‘ and Thucydides δίψη ἄπαυστος among the
prevailing symptoms. adduxerat, ‘ had shrunk,’ lit. ‘ drawn up.⁷

484, 485. rursus, ‘ in turn‚’ as in l. 138. minutatim collapsa
trahebat, ‘dissolved and absorbed piecemeal‚' the superabundant
fluid liquisying the solid parts by putrefaction.

486. honore =‘ sacrifice,’ is common in Virgil. Cp. A. 3. 406
‘in honore deorum‚' ib. 1. 49 ‘ aris imponit honorem.'

487. circumdatur, ‘is being twined round' the victim’s brow.
vitta, descriptive abl ‚ ‘ the woollen fillet with its snow-white band?
The infula was a broad band os wool, tied at intervals with a
narrower band of white ribbon, and fastcned round the head of the
victim. Cp. Lucr. 1. 88 (of the sacrifice of Iphigenia) ‘ infula
virgineos circumdata comptus’; also A. 10. 538 ‘infula cui sacra
redimibat tempora vitta.’

488. cunctantes, i. e. before they had time to kill it. Cp. Ov.
Met. 7. 593

‘ Admoti quotiens templis, dum vota sacerdos
concipit et fundit purum inter cornua vinum,
haud exspectato ceciderunt vulnere tauri?

490, 491. fibris, properly ‘filaments' in the liver (1. 484 ιι),
here used for ‘entrails’ generally. The liquefied state of these
organs would prevent their kindling in the flame, which of itself was
a bad omen: here also the parts themselves were so imperfect that
no omen of any kind could be obtained from them.

492, 493. suppositi, because the victim's throat was cut from
beneath : hence ‘ supponunt cultros: A. 6. 248. ieiuna sanie,
⁶ thin gore‚' instead of a full flow of healthy blood.
